"Ripped offWe were fetched in off the street by their tout. Looked ok. We ordered food and waited. On our table (and all the other tables), was a non descript 750ml bottle of water. I opened it and the waiter immediately appeared with two glasses.
OPENING THAT BOTTLE COST ME AN UNANOUNCED £3.50 WHICH THE STAFF ADDED TO OUR BILL!
Sneaky! Dishonest! Rip off!
They won't be seeing me again........but I expect they don't really care anyway!
WATCH OUT!",1
ridiculous waitWe waited for one and a half hours while every other table received their food even though we were there before every table. There is no excuse for this. Food was nice when it eventually arrived,1
"Never Again!We are really sorry to hear this. Its very unusual for this type of thing to happen and we can only apologise. I will investigate to find out what happened during that service so that this won't happen again. Thanks for your review and for bringing this to light, Sheba",1
"Worst in U.K not best!!! Avoid at any costMaybe the worst service i had in a long time. Went with a group of 15, the starter took too long to come and they gave the main course with the starters, which i thought to be pathetic really! They rushed us, we couldn't even finish our beers. Will never return!",1
"Con artistsTen things wrong with this place. Firstly we booked 2 weeks in advance but still got told to wait as they tried to rush out the poor old bloke and his wife to make room for our table. The elderly couple were in middle of celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary. This was DISGRACEFUL and DISGUSTING to see.I wouldn't have let this happen but I had payed £50 deposit which they won't pay me back if I was to leave or go elsewhere.
Secondly, you can hear the constant battle among the staff. Staff are rude, loud and mono-syllabic. They don't talk to ya and like to give one word answer. We felt like They didn't want us there.
Third, the atmosphere. Generally all types of restaurants serving cuisines from different part of the world has some sort of music playing in the background but this was an exception. The howling, rumbling and puffing from staff is all the entertainment is on offer.
Fourth, the decor is pretty weird. They have pictures of some Bollywood celebrities. How does that correlate to Curry?
Fifth, Terrible toilets. Very poor hygiene. Toilets are unclean and untidy. There wasn't any toilet roll available. We had to ask several time for toilet roll.
Sixth the noisy tout. The chap touting outside seemed to have failed to bring customers in because we saw a lot of people going in to the restaurant next door. This had made the man angry! Every time he would come inside he would kick chairs and spit out pretty rough swearword.
Seventh, we were rushed to place our order but had to wait 45 minutes for starter to come. The table which came after us got their order before but I think they messed it up too because they left soon as the food were on table.
Eighth, the food. The food was ok. Nothing specIal and not what you'd expect from best in UK. Food needs to be worm and on time.
Ninth, when we booked we were told we get free drinks and 20% discount. However, we weren't given what was promised by the manager and instead they had the balls to charge 10% service which wasn't optional and you had to pay. We are good people and don't like arguing therefore, we decided to pay and leave.
Tenth, I have been to other places in . Every other restaurants had made me feel welcome and service has been always above standard. Although, the quality of the food differ from place to places but they have their own special way to make it up to you so you don't go home unhappy. I think that this restaurant shouldn't exist because it's low standard may be putting other good, genuine and striving restaurants down.",1

Bombay spice Paddington stFood was not bad. Daughter had a feed card which they would not let us use because we did not b prebook yet the resuant was empty .there was nothing on the website saying you had to book to use the card. Not over impressed with the service. A,1
Awful experience: don’t trust the good reviewWe went there based on the good grade on TripAdvisor. The waiter was staring at us while we were eating. It’s quite disturbing. We ordered 2 main dishes with one of their special rice and Cheese nan. Of the main dish was special and definitely not in a good way. The other one was just ok. The worst was the special rice with eyebrow and not just one. I spotted 7 - 8 eyebrows. And that was only when I realized more than halfway through my dinner. So I can’t even imagine how many eyebrows I have already eaten. It’s disgusting.,1
"Avoid at all costs..! Overpriced, bland food with miniature portion sizes...Thank you for this review. We have taken into consideration what you have said. However, in the case of eyebrows, our special rice is made with the Indian spices javirti, saffron, whole mace and black cardamoms- these spices can appear to be hair. We hope this helps. We apologise for your unpleasant experience. If you wish to express your concerns further, please contact Bombay Spice directly.",1
"Creepy, super high prices, very less quantities, worst food qualityWe went there on a Saturday evening around 8pm for our table that was booked. Portion sizes were extremely small for £10 per main curry dish. Furthermore, the food tasted very bland and was not hot when served.
When it came to the bill, they conveniently forgot about the tastecard and then charged for Naan breads at full price claiming they're side dishes (menu clearly states it's not).
Quite a diabolical experience - there are far better restaurants in this area in the same price range.
Will not be going here again or recommending it to anybody.",1
"OMG - AVOIDDear Sharan,

Thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

As owner of the restaurant it saddens me to see someone having a bad experience. We will take your feedback on board and hope we can better our service moving forwards.",1
"Oily food, horrendous service, and fraud/overcharged billWe went to have dinner at this restaurant last week and the restaurant was completely empty around 10.30 PM. They greeted us in and we sat down. All waiters (4-5 of them) were staring at our table only, which felt ver weird. We ordered drinks and started looking at the menu to order food. However, the food prices were very high even compared to the other places on the same road. There was no music and the ambiance was pathetic.
When trying to order, the waiter told us that there is a minimum order quantity for 3 people as each of us had to order atleast 1 Large curry even if we are not hungry. When protested, one of the waiters made a rude offensive comment. We let the place and went to some other place down the street.

Worst experience ever. The restaurant is not even Indian, but Bangladeshi and run by all Bangladeshis.

DO NOT EVER EVER EVER even step into .",1
"Visited for dinnerPositively the worst restaurant I have visited. Upon arrival I was greeted by a chap standing outside insisting that I should dine in the restaurant- which was completely empty inside.

Awful experience: don’t trust the good reviewWe went there based on the good grade on TripAdvisor. The waiter was staring at us while we were eating. It’s quite disturbing. We ordered 2 main dishes with one of their special rice and Cheese nan. Of the main dish was special and definitely not in a good way. The other one was just ok. The worst was the special rice with eyebrow and not just one. I spotted 7 - 8 eyebrows. And that was only when I realized more than halfway through my dinner. So I can’t even imagine how many eyebrows I have already eaten. It’s disgusting.,1
"Avoid at all costs..! Overpriced, bland food with miniature portion sizes...Thank you for this review. We have taken into consideration what you have said. However, in the case of eyebrows, our special rice is made with the Indian spices javirti, saffron, whole mace and black cardamoms- these spices can appear to be hair. We hope this helps. We apologise for your unpleasant experience. If you wish to express your concerns further, please contact Bombay Spice directly.",1
"Creepy, super high prices, very less quantities, worst food qualityWe went there on a Saturday evening around 8pm for our table that was booked. Portion sizes were extremely small for £10 per main curry dish. Furthermore, the food tasted very bland and was not hot when served.
When it came to the bill, they conveniently forgot about the tastecard and then charged for Naan breads at full price claiming they're side dishes (menu clearly states it's not).
Quite a diabolical experience - there are far better restaurants in this area in the same price range.
Will not be going here again or recommending it to anybody.",1

"Oily food, horrendous service, and fraud/overcharged billWe went to have dinner at this restaurant last week and the restaurant was completely empty around 10.30 PM. They greeted us in and we sat down. All waiters (4-5 of them) were staring at our table only, which felt ver weird. We ordered drinks and started looking at the menu to order food. However, the food prices were very high even compared to the other places on the same road. There was no music and the ambiance was pathetic.
When trying to order, the waiter told us that there is a minimum order quantity for 3 people as each of us had to order atleast 1 Large curry even if we are not hungry. When protested, one of the waiters made a rude offensive comment. We let the place and went to some other place down the street.

As already mentioned in your previous review from last night, we are very sorry for the inconvenience with your Lobster Linguine.

"Don't Trust Your Reservation ConfirmationDear Charlie,

We are truly sorry for the unfortunate experience you had dining in TOZI on Sunday. This is obviously not the standard that we aim to provide to each and every customer. The Lobster Linguine from you received where over salty and we apologized several times for this. We were ready to make a new portion but you have decided not to have it, as well as a selection of desserts from us.

This sort of inconvenience shouldn't happen, we tried to repair the situation in each and every way as the last thing we want is our customers to leave unhappy or hungry.

I would like to personally discuss the situation and invite you for another meal in TOZI, therefore please get in contact with me sending an email to Stefano@tozirestaurant.co.uk. I would like to be on duty when you decide to visit us and I will make sure it will be an unforgettable experience.

"Terrible Service at Reception - We Walked Out!Dear Jules,

We are very sorry to read your words, our strong kitchen team put a lot of effort and dedication in what they prepare and everything is made from scratch every single morning and we don't like our food to be compared to plastic. We would have loved to discover your thoughts during your meal and not just on Trip advisor. We are all Italian in TOZI and we strongly believe that our food is very authentic, we are sorry if this did not meet your taste.

"Poor service and deceptiveWe had had such a wonderful experience here before the theater several years ago that when we started planning a trip with our three daughters, we knew we wanted to repeat that experience with them. I booked a table over a month ago on OpenTable, noting that we were returning guests hoping to make memories with our teenage kids.

This morning, the day of our reservation, I get an abrupt cancellation notice in email via OpenTable, with zero explanation. I immediately called the restaurant to clarify what I was certain was a mistake, and asked them to call or email me back. At 2 pm I called again. No reply. Only when I went to the website did I suddenly see a notice about a maintenance closure (first time I checked it was through today - now it's changed to be through tomorrow.)

Calendaring mistakes are understandable. What is absolutely not understandable is a restaurant of Tozi's quality and reputation behaving so utterly badly in letting such a glaring mistake happen, then actively ignoring a patron's request for help in fixing it.

I'll never take a restaurant reservation for granted again. And I'll never recommend to any of my traveling friends that they put Tozi on their list of must-visit restaurants, as I have in the past.",1
"Dreadful FoodWent here on the back of tripadvisor ratings and the fact I like the idea of small plates, and love italian food.

The ravioli was okay but no more of a balance of flavour than I could get from a can of Heinz. Sorely disappointing, on the plus side the wine was quite good. The bill was ninety quid to have a cheapish, eat food that was poor in quality and still be starving at the end of it.",1
"Way below averageI am saddened to write this review, but based on my family's experience yesterday, I do not recommend this restaurant, which is actually in the hotel that we are staying in for a week in London, the Park Plaza Victoria. I made reservations on Open Table for dinner last night for a party of 5 at 8:30 pm. My Mom had actually also booked dinner for 8:15 pm independently as we were returning from a day trip to Oxford so she called down to Tozi and told them to cancel her room reservation and keep my OpenTable reservation. At some point in the afternoon, I received a cancellation from the restaurant via OpenTable, but ignored it because I knew that we had another reservation. In any case, when we showed up, the hostess was not very welcoming and seemed hard pressed to find even one of our reservations, but did eventually find it. I then asked to be seated by the window as the restaurant was not crowded (when I made reservations there were seats open every 15 minutes), but was told that there was only a table available in a dark area by the kitchen doors. I told the hostess that we literally had TWO reservations, that I was a Open Table VIP, and the restaurant did not seem crowded, and yet we were being seated at a terrible table. We then asked to speak to the Manager who was very haughty with us. She claimed that she cancelled my OpenTable Reservation because my Mom told her to do so, which was not true. She reiterated what her hostess told us. At that point, a group seated closer to the windows got up and left, so my Mom asked if we could sit up there as there was more light. The manager tells her, ""Well, that not at the window."" We responded that it was closer to the window. She then says, ""That is not possible because that is a table for 4."" At that point, we had had it, and told her we were leaving. However, readers of my review should know that FIVE had been sitting at that table, as far as we could see.....I am not sure what the restaurant manager's issue was, but as a person of color, I did not get a good vibe! She was clearly discriminating against us. I will never ever dine there, and will tell my friends not to do so either. If that is how Tozi wants to run a business, then they will go out of business. My family has dined literally all over the world at highly rated restaurants and holes in the wall, and above all, if you are not gracious as restaurant hosts and clearly seem to discriminate against your customers, things do not bode well for Tozi. BTW, we caught an UBer, and had a wonderful meal at Dishoom in Carnaby, which was crowded beyond belief, but our hosts were exceptionally gracious. A review to come shortly. We also had wonderful meals at Honey & Co., About Thyme, Skylon, and Hoppers, thus far, and expect to have wonderful experiences at Tamarind, the Orangery, Nopi, Palomar, and other places. However, Tozi, will never have me walk through their door again, and it is their loss!",1
"Twilight zone!!!Hello FoodieFosterCity,

We are very sorry to hear your disappointment in regards to your experience in TOZI.

I would like to personally apologies again for cancelling your Open Table reservation as I did the day of your visit. I misunderstood your request of deleting your room reservation when you called in the afternoon. As mentioned, we could have put your Open Table reservation straight back in the system without any problem. For us every customer have the same priority and importance doesn’t matter the way the reservation is made therefore we would never imagine you would be disappointed that we kept your room reservation instead of your Open Table reservation.

Our main goal in TOZI is to make every single customer happy: this is why we always take extra care when we have specific requests for tables by the windows or for special occasion.

Unfortunately your booking did not specify any particular requests and, as the restaurant has just two tables for 5 people by the window, at the time of your arrival both of them were already occupied. The restaurant was not totally full when you arrived, we were expecting more reservations throughout the night and this is why a few tables were empty but the only table for 5 available was the one offered to you, which we personally think is situated in a nice area in the lower deck of the restaurant.

We did offer you to have a drink at the bar until one of the tables by the window were going to be available, we couldn’t just promise a specific waiting time as people were still sitting down finishing their meal.

As mentioned, the table for 4 people that left the upper deck when you were in reception was able to fit 3 – 4 people, we physically couldn’t fit 5 people there and, as your request was for a table by the window, I preferred to specify that the one you pointed was not near the window.

Our aim in TOZI is to let everyone single person feel very welcome since the very first approach as we open our doors until the last goodbye when they leave, we really put a lot of passion and effort in what we do and we are sorry you couldn’t experience this. None of us have ever tried to discriminate customers and it makes us feel very uncomfortable thinking that you felt so.

We are sorry that your decision was to leave the restaurant because you didn’t like the table although we did try to give you other options.

"never experienced such bad servicereally really bad experience with this place! I ordered a simple order of 4 items, it took 50 ,ins to arrival, fair enough,but then I had 1 item missing and another item which was completely wrong. so I call them up and explain and they have no clue, so takes 10 ,ins to explain to 1st staff which he tries to tell me he is going to send me my correct order for free .... excuse me it's not free I already paid for it and didn't get it!!! then then I ask how long it will now take to get my new items ... he doesn't know has to speak to someone else about it... staff #2 comes on phone and again I have to explain myself again and then wait for him to pull up my order for him to check what I am saying is true..... so then I ask if as a gesture to a unhappy customer if they will refund me my 2 items I never got and now have to wait another 40 mins to get ..... while my other food is getting cold .... answer to my request for refund was ,, arh as you paid online we can't refund you, you already paid...... nothing we can do!!!!! kept trying to tell me that I am getting my money worth because hey we're sending out my food again.... the ones that was missing in first place... !! kept trying to offer me more other food for free... which I had to repeat my self over 10 times, I did not want other food, just the correct ones I ordered...! managed did not want to talk to to on phone,because he didn't want to give me any money back to correct their mistake and keep good customer service, which is something they REALLY do not have. DO NOT USE THIS PLACE!!! you run the risk of paying for food you get get to eat and wait almost 2 hrs.....",1
"ROCK HARD BURGERJust driven my daughter back yo this place on Norbury High Road (London Road).
I overheard her shouting about a steak burger she had just paid £13 for. I went to see what it was all about and to my utter horror, the roll was as hard as rock. Probably left in the microwave for much more than it should. I drove my daughter there, I stayed in the car.
She decided to ask for a refund and obviously a free burger got the inconvenience!

By the way, they will not accept a card (debit) so my daughter had to go and get cash fron a cash point.

They initially refused to refund and offered to give another burger. My daughter stood her ground but the person dealing with her said their policy was not to refund as the refund will have to come out of their pocket. He was reminded that payment was made in cash.

Eventually she got her money back and asked if there was any form of SWEETNER as they have inconvenienced her

It was an ENPHATIC NO!!!

Well we are done!! Never again and if I have to go hungry rather than go to this place again, SO BE IT",1
"Filthy, Poorly Managed and Meh!New door? Great! Nothing else has changed thought.

Walked in and the music was blaring. We were quickly shown a table; the place was pretty much empty apart from a group of noisy youths; probably friends or family of the waiters because they (the waiters) were milling around them - didn't see them pay either.

The table was obviously not wiped; no problem there - just did it myself. Drinks? Yes please; a large bottle of sparkling water. No sparkling water? OK then, a large bottle of still water please? No large still water either? Bring 1 small still water them please and glasses with ice. Here he comes with 2 bottles of still water and 1, yes one ice cube in each glass.

By now I'm bored so I look up to the ceiling. 18, yes eighteen light bulbs out. Oh, and that area where the old entrance was, just a big old hole and some loose wire hanging out. Part of the new decor? There also seem to be a toilet leak from the flat above; yellow salty looking stains in their way to form stalactites staring blatantly at me.

Apart from the dirt on the table there's so many scratches and damage to the table tops. All you need is a bit of sandpaper and varnish mate. Have some pride in your place.

Meal was OK. Just OK.

Let's pay and get out of here; the CC machine is out of order. Typical. So I wonder if that's why the youths didn't pay. So now we have to go to the bank 2 blocks away to get cash but only if one of us stay here so that we 100% come back to pay.

Apart from being disgustingly dirty, this place has no clue of how a restaurant should be run and the franchise should retract from the owner which is probably the same guy who owns filthy Mirch Masala across the road.

Note to the owner; a new door does not polish a turd Habibi. In another note; Steakout fits perfectly into Norbury - a third world establishment which wormed its way into a world class city.",1
"Awful avoid at all costsCame here on a friday lunctime and was appalled by the hygiene and cleanliness of the restaurant , the floors were filthy and the tables were sticky and greasy. I regret not leaving at this point but we stuck it out because we were hungry.
I took advantage of the lunch offers, steak with chips for 6.95. My steak arrived cold and unseasoned, tasted bland. The peppercorn sauce was lumpy and luke warm. Extremely disappointing , standards have dropped considerably and the service was equivalent to a zombie, uninterested and non existent.

Sort out your hygiene and your standard of food Steakout!!!!!",1
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!Each food ordered was either over or under cooked (bloody chicken wings & burnt steak). The waiter did not check to make sure the table was clean before he sat us at the table (it was dirty). Staff members did not check to see if food was okay. Food was way TOO overpriced for such a poor experience. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!,1
Poor effortThis place was a let down. From going on the website it looked like a nice place to try. Steak dry and it looked like it was hit with a sledge hammer. All steaks not cooked to request. Starters were obviously party food from Iceland across the road. Informed the managers that the steak was cold and all they said is we will do better next time. Big time give it a miss.,1
"Disappointing!!It was so disappointing to go back to this once incredible restaurant! They no longer have the same portions as they did before and when I asked the waiter why they no longer serve the basic onion/tomato/cucumber salad with the meal I was informed that I have to 'purchase' that separately . On asking why we were told that it was under new management . Usually under new managements there should be 'better' improvements not ripping people off by not only increasing the prices for lesser portions but also having to pay for something restaurants provide with meals i.e. Salad!
Most things on the menu weren't even available. Such a shame we won't be going back there. I spoke to some friends who also said the same thing! The dodgy crowd doesn't help either, who are constantly swearing while you're sitting on the next table with kids in tow!
Yet another restaurant that's made money and now about to lose long term customers!",1
"Inconsistent and disappointing!I am still confused as to how the brand has survived let alone expanded. Have been on a number of occasions to different branches, so I will give you a rounded opinion.

Food is fresh, but not great. Stakes and burgers are a disappointments. On many occasions order food and get told that they don't have part of the burger or a sauce is finished. Juices are not juices... They pore mango drink from a rubicon carton. Prices are way too high for what you get in return. Service. Is so slow, so if you do want to compromise on the above and go just for the experience that fine. But go a hour before you would get hungry so you don't feel like strangling the waiters.

Have known of friends and family to wait over an hour for food takeaway in the Slough branch.",1
"Pass it byVisited for a friends birthday and I should have gone on my first impression and walked out. I'm going to keep this short and to the point. Steak was like leather, frozen vegetables which where warm not hot, their hand cut onion rings were also from the freezer. Half the items that were on the menu were also not available. I complained about my steak and got a sorry that was all. There where 3 of us just 3 main courses and 3 diet cokes the bill was £65. As I say pass it by!!!!",1
"AbysmalAwful food, awful staff and over rated price. We walked in and the waiters/owners were quite rude.. They couldn't take joke and rushed the order as they had to leave the order hanging over 3 times.

We thought it would get better.. So I asked for a well done steak and I was advised to go for a medium well done.. I followed the advice fro the expert!!

As it was a T bone steak.. I thought the cut had different cuts of meat such as fillet sirloin etc.. I ate the steak thinking it would get better.. The more I are the harder it got.. As wrong as this may sound!

I therefore decided to get my husband to try my steak as by that time my back tooth was in pain!!!! My husband was quite shocked at how chewy the meat was and asked if I wanted something else.. From steakout??? Not really!!!

Anyway.. The waiter came with the bill and I complained about the meat.. He had the audacity to tell me that if I went to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, he would refuse to serve me a medium to well done as that's not how steak is eaten! Well excuse me.. That's probably the reason why I didn't chose to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant!
Secondly.. He got very defensive saying that I should have known what to order.. Again.. I'm sorry but I was advised by your staff!!!

Finally.. When we went to pay, we were told that the card machine is not working.. Minor issue but after being greeted and served in a very unfriendly manner, I don't think a faulty machine is what we want!!!

We got a 10% discount but if rather pay a little more at Sahara grill and enjoy the food, have a nice time in a nice environment and be spoken to with respect!

I would even recommend jungle braai and coffee inn over steakout!!! I really don't know what the waiters attitude and arrogance are for!!!",1
"never experienced such bad servicereally really bad experience with this place! I ordered a simple order of 4 items, it took 50 ,ins to arrival, fair enough,but then I had 1 item missing and another item which was completely wrong. so I call them up and explain and they have no clue, so takes 10 ,ins to explain to 1st staff which he tries to tell me he is going to send me my correct order for free .... excuse me it's not free I already paid for it and didn't get it!!! then then I ask how long it will now take to get my new items ... he doesn't know has to speak to someone else about it... staff #2 comes on phone and again I have to explain myself again and then wait for him to pull up my order for him to check what I am saying is true..... so then I ask if as a gesture to a unhappy customer if they will refund me my 2 items I never got and now have to wait another 40 mins to get ..... while my other food is getting cold .... answer to my request for refund was ,, arh as you paid online we can't refund you, you already paid...... nothing we can do!!!!! kept trying to tell me that I am getting my money worth because hey we're sending out my food again.... the ones that was missing in first place... !! kept trying to offer me more other food for free... which I had to repeat my self over 10 times, I did not want other food, just the correct ones I ordered...! managed did not want to talk to to on phone,because he didn't want to give me any money back to correct their mistake and keep good customer service, which is something they REALLY do not have. DO NOT USE THIS PLACE!!! you run the risk of paying for food you get get to eat and wait almost 2 hrs.....",1

AvoidFood was substandard and service average. Expensive for what it is. Does not take card payments which I always find suspicious.,1
Recently not as good as previous visitsWe like to visit this restaurant quite often and have always enjoyed the food. The past two times the quality and quantity of the food has dramatically gone down hill. The lamb served was just awful and the dish was so small for a main. The Sunday lunch portions have also reduced in size. Veg and potatoes are cheap so why only one slice of carrot on my Sunday roast?! Prices have gone up and all else has gone down! A real shame,1
"We would not be backWe went as a party consisting of 2 adults and 3 teenagers to celebrate wedding anniversary. From starters through the mains food was hardly edible. Thai fish cakes were so salted you couldn't even taste fish, meat in a burger was too dry, from the duck confit dish only managed to eat duck as the potato was the worst I had in my life (didn't know you could spoil such a simple thing) and mashed vegetables tasted of curry spice, and mash with a sausage tasted artificial, while tandoori chicken wasn't special either. What is worse, the service was applying. I am not sure if it was because we were with teenagers or we are not native English. No one bothered to mention the specials that were not listed on the menu (we heard all other customers promptly informed), no one asked if there was anything wrong with the food despite the fact that only 1 out of 5 of us din't leave majority of the food on the plate. On the way out we passed the waitresses who did not even wished us 'Goodnight'. A shame that a place that we had picked to celebrate such special occasion left us feeling so disappointed.",1
"Obviously they don't need my moneySo what you do is, ring a day in advance to reserve a table for evening service; no-one answers, then you leave a voicemail with all your reservation details as requested. Do they ring you back? do they heck as like. So you ring during lunch opening hours on the day and it rings off the hook - not even the opportunity to leave another (presumably ignored) message. Try Eat17 over the road, they seem to be in business !!!!",1
Afternoon lunchHad an awful experience at this restaurant. The service was absolutely abysmal so slow and orders all wrong. It was severely understaffed. The waitress was running around like a headless chicken. The food was not up to beefeater standard. Very disappointing especially when staying in the onsite hotel.,1
"nasty foodnever in youre life eat here. they didn、t should open a restaurant, keep away from this place, bad cheff if you want to closed do not allow people sit down. and respect forigers they pay youres checks.",1
"From bad to worseI arrived out of the snow to a less than half full restaurant opposite my new flat, no one acknowledged my arrival no one waiting to seat guests.
I eye balled someone until they finally came over to seat me.
After some time I was asked if anyone had offered me a drink which they had not, I ordered my refill Coke and cheese tart with sweet potato fries, no drink arrived, to my surprise a tart with boiled potatoes was bought to the table I advised the waiter I had ordered sweet potato fries so he took it away again, no drink still so I asked again for it, it came over the now cold re plated cheese tart arrived with a separate small bowl of sweet potato fries not worth the £3.99 price in my opinion I asked for mayo, you've guessed it non came, tables around me were being cleaned but no one asked how my meal was I paid and left",1
"Outrageous!!! Never experienced ANYTHING like this!!!We decided to visit here on a spur of the moment and couldn’t have regretted anything more than that! I usually always check reviews and didn’t here... HUGE mistake!

We waited about 5 minutes to sit down in an empty restaurant- never a good sign. We were seated on a nice big table so we were happily duped in to believing this was a good situation.

We ordered our meals and drinks all at the same time. A lovely lady took the order- only to then be replaced with quite possibly the worst waitress I’ve ever come across in my life.

She came to the table and announced “er yeah we have no hardys” to me- apparently all women drink wine so it must be mine. I pointed to my husband who told her that he would have a rekordlig instead.

Our drinks were eventually brought to us- everything moves remarkably slow here. However they had given my husband the low alcohol one. We waited a little longer for our starters to come and relayed the information to the waitress who cut over us with “ok wait a minute” my husband replied “it’s fine I don’t want it please bring me some water” and the woman raised her hand to her face and gestured something. Again we commented on how rude she was. We then watched her take plates to somebody, take an order from a party and come back to make excuses to the party adjacent about why their food has taken so long. She continued on to inform them about her two children that were arguing at home and that she only had an hour left of her shift and all she wants to do is go home so she knew how they felt waiting for food...? I stress she was incredibly friendly to ALL parties but us and the party directly next to us. I wonder if it had something to do with the skin colour!

In the mean time we have tried to eat our starters. The mushrooms were actually really nice, however the chicken wings were beyond disgusting. Bland tasteless non seasoned. My husband refused to eat these. We were prepared to deal with that until.. after 30 minutes to by, the original waitress returned to tell us they had no beef for my husbands main. At which point we were so angry, we said cancel everything we don’t want to eat here anymore, the waitress is rude and this is a joke. We would pay for my drink and my food but not the rest!

The woman approached the member of staff in question on the opposite side of the restaurant. However, as this woman was so incredibly loud and inappropriate it was very clear she said “I was serving food and he starting shouting at waiving his hands around” well, I saw red. How very dare she lie about my husband like this. I was horrified with her! I said excuse me what was that- VERY loudly across the room. To which I was ignored. My partner asked what she had said and when I told him he said how dare you lie about me come and speak to me yourself. When she approached my partner told her very clearly we should NOT be aware of her personal situation, we shouldn’t know her children are arguing or she needs to get home. She argued with us and raised her voice. Shouted ok whatever and put her hand up- ironically. I said where is your manager! She pointed at a young girl who barely had anything to say as the situation was out of hand.

The party who had been subjected to the majority of the woman’s unprofessionalism- clearly heard her lying about what she had spoken about and in solidarity they decided to leave too along with another other couple and a baby.

This party had been told there was a delay due to them not ordering their one piece of garlic bread to come with their mains...?!?!?

I have never ever walked out of an establishment without paying. Never. However, there was nothing in this world that would have allowed me morally to compensate anybody working here for their job.

On a Sunday in a beefeater you shouldn’t even be able to get a seat. There were 6 members of staff in the entire building and several unhappy people! I saw people having to ask for the bill and chase them around to pay!

There is absolutely no chance we will ever return here- it’s overpriced anyway so you expect a level of service etc far far beyond this!!",1
"Ruined valentines eveningBooked restaurant for 7:30pm and the valentines special meal. We arrived on time and was sat promptly to our seats, next to us was an older couple sitting with their coats on, I thought they might be leaving and thought no more of it. Our order was taken quickly and then we realised. We was sitting next to fire exit and draft was billowing through, it was so cold. It took about 10 minuets to get attention of waitress and we asked to be moved table due to the cold. There was about 8 empty tables and we was told no, all tables are booked. No specific table had been booked! I told them we wouldn’t be able to enjoy our meal in the cold and would have to leave if we could not move table. They said they could not move us so we had to leave even though there was still a lot of empty tables!
As you can imagine, we could not find another restaurant at such late note and ended up going home an cooking. Thanks for ruining valentines evening beefeater, will be looking forward to your response before I contact your head office with complaint.",1
"Better of going to WeatherspoonsPoor pub quality food at central London prices. The sharing starter platter was decent if not on the bland side. To start after attempting to order several burgers, we were informed they only had two out of a possible six! And they didn’t have any lobster. The mains we ended up getting were awful, my wife had the Cod and chips, the Cod was soggy and appeared like it was microwaved, the chips were cold, spongy and reheated with poor grey looking peas straight out of a can. Informed the waitress who was helpful and duly replaced it with a reorder that was actually palatable. My main was the porterhouse steak, the worst steak I’ve ever had, the pepper sauce (which costs extra) barely made the stringy chewy mess edible. The only redeeming thing was the sweet potato fries but it’s difficult to mess that up. Considered getting desert but thought we had punished ourselves enough. Would definitely not recommend this place, go to Weatherspoons for nicer food at a third of the price or even better go straight to Iceland.",1
"Worst Beefeater ever :(We was passing, hungry, but the well known brand ""Beefeater"" showed it's sign as we turned the corner.

It's been a long time since we've done a Beefeater, due to problems even gettin seated.

Into the paid car park, I expected to get a voucher reclaimable inside.. nope.

Eventually found the door in, caught the eye of the member of staff chatting at the bar, seated by the door. I was hungry so ordered lots.

Starter came out with the prestarter which barely fitted on the table, the starters where bland. Waitresses passed closed by neglecting to ask if I wanted a top up.

Main courses came out, food slapped on the plates, the waitress ran off but I managed to call for a top up just before she escaped.. No ""Enjoy your meal"" or do you want any sauces. We had to move the empty starters (or half eaten) onto the table beside as they wasn't moved.. On return of the refil the waitress did clear the starters but I had to ask for sauces.

Sadly the mains wasn't good, chips just cooked, ribs just cooked too, chicken breast ok, burger below par, we couldn't be bothered to wait and pay and paid by the door, again no one asked how the food was as I suspect they know it's bad without being told.

Sadly this does confirm the state of beefeaters and it's' one brand we can now permanently avoid.",1
"BreakfastLuke warm Beans, Hash Browns and Tomato. Under cooked sausage, overcooked rubbery eggs. No sausage, poor quality sausage. Poor service. Almost a week now and no sign of improving. Toaster hardly ever assembled properly to catch toast and goes down the back of the table more often than not. 20 minutes this morning to get breakfast? after all the confusion. Order not taken properly. No plate service even though told it was, everyone having to get their own. Waitress just keeps disappearing , Chef waiting for orders then changed to buffet after most customers had been served, eventually ???? Absolute disaster. It would be comical if it werent so bad. Travelodge was poor, this has now set the bar even lower for staying over in Woolwich. 1 person on food service while it's busy taking tickets??, 2 people on reception which is pretty much self service??? The world has gone mad. Sort yourselves out, Extremely disappointing.",1
"Unsuccessful mealPoor considering such a new venue and beefeater restaurants allegedly the flagship of the whitbread line. Our waiter Eddie was brilliant really helpful and friendly, nice setting and atmosphere but that’s were it stops.
The starters a sharing potatoe dippers was tasty and hot the mushrooms were bland and Luke warm . A slight wait for mains which Eddie advised us mains turned up shamefully 1 out of 4 meals was nice , I had the chicken escolarde with sweet potato chip upgrade tasty hot and nicely cooked. Wife had chicken rib combo which was cold and first came with boiled potatoes, it was returned and came back with cold fries back in the kitchen and finally came out hot with fries as requested, inlaws had mixed grills each witch looked like it had been just thrown on a plate were both lukewarm the steak was dry and over cooked, the gammon looked pale and anemic, chicken was very chewy was a very poor attempt at a meal. Will not be going again to this establishment ever.",1
"Beefeater #icelandsfinestBefore today I've always rated beefeater relatively high, today was a massive disappointment.
Nothing wrong with the service, but the food was beyond acceptable especially for the price.
My starter of "" buttermilk"" chicken goujons was £5.99 for 5 but my partners main of buttermilk chicken burger (3 goujons) with sweet potatoe fries, 3 very small onion rings and industrial made coleslaw was an astonishing £14.50 and we were wondering were the extra £8.50 comes from with the two less goujons? And as for my £15.50 rack of ribs which were so blatantly pulled out of a packet, noticeable
by the single layer of conjealed bbq sauce on top!
Word of advice, save yourself the £ and visit Iceland yourself.",1
"Tasty Meal.They have a good range of things to choose from, including a kids menu which is extremely convenient. The location isn't too bad, it stands out from the other shops & businesses on that road, which is a main road. Service was decent, may vary according to how busy the restaurant is. Overall, it was a pleasant meal & I would go back again.",1
"Great food! I recommendI recently visited the restaurant and it impoved in terms of quality of food, menu, price, atmosphere and look. Lovely waitress and very good food. Will defiantly visit again, best restaurant in town!",1
"Nice food, no atmosphereI took my 5 year old for lunch and the food was good value and well presented - a notch up from fast food and probably on a par with nandos (but cheaper).

He had the kid's steak and chips which was massive (but overcooked) and I had a peri peri burger with corn on the cob which was tasty but not very spicy. I probably could have asked for it hotter though.

It was empty on a Saturday lunchtime so no real atmosphere. I will go back though as the waiter worked his charm offensive, saying I looked 10 years younger than I am :)",1
NiceBeen there a couple of times and definitely one of the better burger places around. Service a little slow but food made up for it.,1
"Best local restaurant aroundWent to the restaurant with a group of friends, 9 of us in total and we were immediately amazed at the hospitality displayed by the staff working there. A warm welcome was given and we were sat down on a spacious table with an inviting atmosphere. Once we all placed our order of steaks, burgers, kebabs and grills our drinks, mostly milkshakes were served to us within 15 minutes and 10 minutes later, our sizzling food was prepared and handed to us by the waiter. Overall the visit was an excellent one and totally worth it, my group of friends all had a blast and we chilled around for quite some time afterwards, definitely recommend eating here, my return to the business is pretty much inevitable",1
"AWFUL - SEE MY EMAIL TO LIVINGSOCIAL....PLEASE READ MY EMAIL TO LIVINGSOCIAL AS THIS WAS A VOUCHER FOR 4:

I bought this and a couple of others as gifts but the place was awful. The food tasted as if it was cooked the day before (maybe a few days before) and reheated but cold by the time it got to us. It was 1.30pm on a Sunday and there was just one staff who served, heated food, served, answered phones and acted as the cashier. Prior to that we had to drive for half an hour looking for parking as it was all either double yellow lines or permit holders only so I risked and parked on yellow as the kids were starved. Not a good experience at all and I'm actually disappointed by Livingsocial for entertaining such establishments, it gives you a bad name. I need to cancel the other 2 vouchers please as I don't want my friends which the vouchers are for to go through the same experience, it will be an embarrassment to me for sending them there. How do we go about it?",1
"Don't waste your time (lot's of it)Went with my girlfriend after she got some online voucher.

When we went in we were sat pretty quickly and not given a menu, we ended up waiting, and I'm not joking, 45 minutes before we got our drinks (a can of diet coke and a smoothie), despite us pestering the ""waitress"" several times. Once we got them and the menu we ordered our food and that took a further 45-60 mins to arrive. When it came I would describe it as poor but not dreadful.

For the price it might be worth trying as a takeaway.",1
"Worst steak ever!I had wanted to try this restaurant out for a while as it was fairly local and my partner loves his steak. So I grabbed the chance when I saw the Wowcher deal for 2 Sirloin steak meals for £13.50.
It was also my birthday coming up so being short of money we went there to celebrate.
First impressions we not too hot, there were two tables out the front that looked nice but were now roped off which was odd as it was still early and a lovely day mid July. The tables outside had not been cleared and there was rubbish on the floor so not a good impression on the outside but it fits in with the rest of that area, grubby! The decor inside was quite nice, it does have potential to be a nice place.
Anyway, as it was a grill restaurant, I was surprised to see it was run by Asian people, but looking at the menu it was an interesting selection and looked good.
Our Wowcher was for a 10oz Sirloin steak with rice, chips salad and choice of sauces, so we ordered and chose our sauce, they only had 2 out of the 5 on offer but my favorite mushroom sauce was there. I had to prompt the waiter to take down how we wanted the steak cooked, both medium rare, as he didn't ask. We also ordered portions of loaded skins and scampi and 2 diet cokes. The cokes came quite promptly, in a can, followed by the starters, which at £4 each were quite costly in my opinion and the portions were very small and tasted like supermarket frozen ones. The steak then arrived about half an hour later and were smothered with the sauce, I actually quite liked the sauce although salty but had to scrape some off to get to the steak. Now I know sirloin steak and this was not it. It was bashed and stretched so far with a tenderiser that the size was ok but it was so thin it was like cheap frying steak, definitely not 10oz but also very grisly and overly spiced with something odd. We were worried that the flavors were to hide the quality and taste of the meat, was it even Beef? I really could not tell. I felt quite ill just eating it, and my partner tried hard to eat his, but couldn't as i put him off by keep spiting out my gristle (very embarrassing in a restaurant), so we ate the chips (no rice served) salad was just a garnish and paid at the counter and left never to return. What a shame as the restaurant does have potential to help turn this area into somewhere decent where people want to spend time, close to Walthamstow station. The local decent people need good restaurants, not another kebab shop.",1
Don't botherWent on a wowcher deal and I suppose for £6 per person you can't expect much but the so called sirloin steak was thin over cooked and spiced up. Was this to disguise the quality if the meat? staff were bemused when we asked them how we would like our steaks cooked!. It may be a decent take away but unless you are on a very tight budget don't waste the petrol money to get here,1
"ApallingWe had Wowcher tickets to this restaurant as it were 2 steaks for £13.50, which includes rice, chips, salad and a chosen sauce, we thought that we should give it a try since the value was worth it.

The first things that struck us were the service: it was terrible, they had little knowledge in parking spaces and of the around area to answer the question of : is there parking spaces? Another lady that spoke to us over the phone only asked us to reserve a specific time to make herself sound more ""professional"" as well..

When we arrived at the restaurant, the service continued to be appalling: drinks took at least 30 minutes: 2 Fererro rocher shakes and 2 J2O's.

They also refused to give us what was advertised on Wowcher, the rice, though we asked for medium rare steaks but each steak came differently cooked: Some were very chewy, whereas some were tender.

We expect that they put the steaks on the grill one by one and took them all off at the same time.

All in all, the taste of the steaks were decent, but the unfriendliness of the staff is very appalling, which in my opinion, cancels out the merits of the taste because we felt very unwelcome.

I felt that this restaurant was run by teenagers as they did not know the basics of answering the phone as a company and they used a lot of slang language.",1
January '11Complete rubbish if I'm honest. Food was disgusting when they finally got the order right. Toilets had urine all over the floor and cubicles clearly hadn't been cleaned in months. Worst resteraunt I've ever been to,1
"Do not ever enter this place. Ever!!Where to start. First of all we were informed only taking cash as cards not working. That's fine we thought. Next the manager was sat at the bar having a full blown argument with a member of staff on the phone. Embarrassing. The decor is 80's, I love a bit of 80's, but this place has clearly not been painted or cleaned since then!
The food. Oh my days. Myself and my partner ordered fillet steak, mushrooms and chips. With a side order of peppercorn sauce. The mushrooms were tinned, the steak definitely not fillet, and the peppercorn sauce was thick bisto with a few peppercorns thrown on top.
It was so expensive too. Which we expect in London. But a steak house that doesn't know which steak is which and how to make pepper corn sauce, come on!
We actually can't stop laughing at our experience at this restaurant. It was tragic. We felt so sorry for the poor waiters and expected them to mouth ""help us"".
Just don't go!",1
Avoid!!!!!!!!!This was one of the worst eating experiences of my life!!! Please do yourself - and your wallet - a big favour and avoid at all costs. Disgusting.,1
"Don't go there...Worst meal ever, do not go there. Bad steaks and only cash payment, no real bill. The medium cooked steak was really bloody and did not taste good at all.",1
"Shocking, shocking, shocking!I don't normally write reviews but in this instance I thought I'd make an exception.

It was sh1t... under no circumstances should you eat at this restaurant!

Everything about the 'experience' was awful, oh and watch out for the additional 'cover charge' per person. Still not too sure what this was for, I think it was in return for allowing us to eat in their disgusting building.

Only positive part of the night was turning others away at the door!",1
"They don't understand you - Never go there!!!Unfortunately we went into this restaurant on a Thursday evening. We just wanted to eat a fish and chips. We were put on the first floor which had a nice view onto the street but this was the only good experience. The space was quite busy downstairs but upstairs we were the only ones. The place was cold, only an electric heater was in operation. We ordered beers(budweiser, kronenburg, stella artois) and ginger and we ended up receiving budweiser, some kind of bitter beer and coke. They run out of ginger but forgot to mention that they don't have kronenburg neither. On the bill there were all 3 beers plus ginger. We asked for a shared plate but waitress didn't understand what we asked for and needed to speak to the main waiter. For the main course we ordered fish and chips and some other meals. But they run out of fish and chips. Iit was only 7 o'clock. What supply do they have? They served the starter after a long wait and we couldn't finish because the brought tha mains. The waitress said ""Sorry, we needed to bring it becuase it was ready"". But not us with the starter. The waitress could barely understand english asked back all the time.
As I mentioned when we received the bill it contained more items that we ordered but at that time we just wanted to get out from the place.
The waiters seem Italians as I heard them sepaking in italian.
Never go there!!! It's expensive(fish and chips advertised for 15 punds, was only 8 in the next pub). And as I see from the reviews all the restaurants in London with the name ""Scotch Steak House"" have very bad reputation and reviews. What a shame...",1
"Don't go there.We went here as it was opposite he theatre we were visiting later. It was quite quiet which should have given us a clue.
A lady outside showed us the pre theatre menu which looked quite good value. We went in and sat down. Two of our party wanted sparkling water and two wanted white Pinot Grigio. They had no Pinot and when the water came it was still. The waitress did tell us she wouldn't charge for and brought us a bottle of sparkling.
A couple of us decided to order chicken dishes from the pre theatre menu, but before we could the waitress told us they had runout of chicken. The menu heavily features chicken and steak and this was before 7 pm. She seemed really surprised when we all stood up and walked out!",1
"Scotch Steak HousePlease note the actual name of this 'restaurant' is the Scotch Steakhouse and not Scott's. It is situated on the cornor of Shaftesbury avenue and Wardour Street.

"Do not go hereThis has got to be the worst restaurant I have ever had the displeasure to visit. We visited on Saturday 24th November at around 8pm. The floor under the table was covered in rubbish, used forks and dirt. The shelves along the side that the wine sits on were covered in dirt and dust. I had to ask for my wine glass to be replaced twice as it was covered in fingerprints and dust.

We both ordered ribs as starter and I ordered a ribeye for main and my partner a rump. When the ribs arrived there were from frozen stock (not fresh) and when I bit into them there was blood in the middle and they were still frozen (on both portions). These were immediately returned. When my steak arrived it was a sirloin instead of a ribeye (a steak house that can't tell the difference in steak cuts). ,y Parthers steak was meant to be medium but was cremated and my chips looked like they had been cooked several hours previously. Finally the guys eating next to us (two pilots from Norway) asked if we had been to the toilets yet..we hadn't... they suggested the the best things to do was not to as they were disgusting.

We sent back our mains, asked for the bill for the wine which we had only half drunk. We paid for the wine and left. The waiter came after us to ask for the bill back and we asked why. He said they needed it for their records and said he would write out a new one. When we went back he tried to write out a bill which only detailed the wine and not all the items we had sent back so we said no as we wanted proof that we had ordered and returned the food.

On our return home I emailed Westminster environmental health as the standard of cleanliness and overall food safety were exceptionally poor.",1
"Worst meal I have ever eaten in a Restaurant, a right rip off!!!I have just eaten here tonight and it is the worse meal I have ever eaten out in a restaurant!!! The staff are well odd and once you have ordered they then let you know they only take cash and there is a cash point next door! The drinks came and my gin and tonic was like water and my husbands pint was flat, worse he had ever tasted, he left it. We had our 2 daughters with us and one had water that she even said tasted odd. We ordered 3 steaks and 1 kebab, when it came it even looked vile! Chips were heated up, steak was tough as old boots, vegetable were also heated up. We were going to see Ghost the musical so we went here before the show, my god what mistake! The bill was £80.50 and it wasn't worth a tenner!!! Like the previous review wrote they wished they had gone to MacDonalds and that is exactly what we said to each other!!! I dread to think what the kitchens are like!",1

"Don't botherI've been to Del'Aziz twice before. This visit was absolutely horrendous. The service was comical. Our waitress and waiter couldn't answer any questions about the drinks menu or the food. Neither spoke enough English to understand what we were asking and both claimed that being new to the restaurant was why they didn't know any thing.

We ordered Calamari and it was served over cooked with what could only be described as rabbit droppings. After asking the waiter to find out what they were supposed to be he came back to explain they were deep friend mussles. They were the single most disgusting thing I have ever tasted in a restaurant.
Even though we were clear in our shock at how bad the food was and repeated requests to ask if the chef meant to serve something so awful the waiter came back to say he had, and they were ""fine"" in the chefs opinion.

To make matters worse the main then arrived after a long wait, the two chicken dishes were served to the table cold with clearly microwaved rice. We sent the mains back, cancelled the orders and left. Again the restaurant offered no apology or reason.

It's so dissapointing that a local restaurant which could serve decent nice food would let that type of food leave the kitchen. I'm a home cook and would be embarrassed to serve anything like that, I'd also expect better food from my local 24hr kebab house.

Don't visit or waste your money here.",1

"family lunchTook my grandchildren for a family lunch recently & was very disappointed with the poor quality service & food the noodles were inedible greasy over fried with just 3 slithers of chicken costing £8 a plate the dumplings were ok but @ £1 each far too expensive the jasmine tea was £3 a small pot!
With so many better value Chinese restaurants close by I shall not be going back.",1
"Horrible!!!Wnated a quick dinner before a west end show so we walked until we saw this restaurant...Looked good from outside... Came promptly to the table. Asked for recoemmendations and she told us to look at the menu. We ordered the first course and drinks. She asked if we wanted anything else so we ordered the second course. They brought us our second course dishes first, laying them all over the table, then brought us the dumplings. By this time the table was full. Then they brought us soups. So the table was overflowing. We asked that they not bring the crispy duck until we were finished. They still brought it 5 minutes later. We asked them to take it back. 4 people came over and then they decided that they could keep it warm until later. The food was very tasteless. The soups were very glutinous. The food contained MSG and still tasted of nothing. One of the dumpling was OK, the crispy duck, even though it had been kept warm was OK. I would never go again. They also added on a random amount of tip and for 4 people was £86 and we were still hungry!",1
"Terrible! Would never go again""We wanted to grab some food before we went to see The Jersey Boys so we liked the look of Dumpling Inn and went in. So much went wrong I'll have to list it:

1) They kept mixing our drinks orders up or completely forgetting to bring some of our drinks at all

2) My sister ordered the highly recommended pork and my dad order Liver, both arrived and there was hardly any meat it was just all fat.

3) All the staff were moody and unwelcoming, none of them would make eye contact with us.

4) When we complained to the manager he offered to take the two meals off but then they still tried to charged us almost £15 for service charge.",1
Very poor mealMe and my friend came to this restaurant and ordered same meal/dish. The sirloin steak of 8 Oz. The joke was the different btwn both dishes. Look the picture. The manager told us the oz were the same. ;). Second joke!,1
"Don't Waste your money plenty better places aroundVery average and very over priced

It's all very rushed the service, feel more like you are in a cattle market than a restaurant, especially as you are so close to the next table
Not good value for money as everything is an extra can't imagine it would get away with some average food for being so overpriced anywhere else but in London
Plenty mor egrets steak places, Cote is 1000% better than any of these restaurants and this is my third and final visit to them",1
"Avoid!!!Service was exceptionally slow. Childrens meal came out with the wrong side, well done steak was identical to the medium. Both were medium well in my opinion. Neigher were served with the sauces ordered. When the correct side was eventually served to my daughter the server left a spoon in it that was so hot it burnt her mouth.

I would recommend everyone stay well clear which is a shame as the others I have visited were really nice.",1
"Disability unfriendlyPopped in here and asked if they had a lift to the main lower area for my daughter who is a wheelchair user, they said yes and led us through to start moving a table out of the way so we could reach it, they then said we'd have to wait a minute or two while they moved the people who were eating their meal at the table that was in the way at the lower level. At this point we declined to go any further as it would be rude to move those people, my daughter rightly pointed out that it was wrong that the lift was blocked at all. The hostess looked at my daughter like she was filth. Appalling attitude by the staff and company. Went to the Coventry Street one across the road, much better.",1
"Not got a clueArrived at the restaurant and received a good welcome. Food is expensive and does not come with anything so if you order steak you get just steak. So I ordered corned beef croquet for starter and this arrived twice. For main I ordered steak with onion rings and new potatoes, firstly it arrived as a rack of ribs with nothing else. Then when it did arrive they had run out of potatoes and so they just changed it to baked potato with asking first. Worst £36.50 I have ever spent on a 2 course meal. Plenty of other options in Leicester Square!!!!",1
"Worse service ever!Only the up front girls were nice and give us a nice welcome, but the waiters are awful. Not even a slice of power to try or pretend that they are doing the best, not even a smile or showing us the menu. Words coming up so slowly, bearly i could understand something, explanation for the food was terrible, "" how should i know? I'm just a waiter"". Ok, if you don't know, than who?!
Food was acceptable, not bad, but could be better!
This restaurant, doesn't worth the effort to spend money and time there! For sure, is not gonna be another time!",1
"Post show mealWe were advised that our steaks would be around 25 minutes to be cooked so would we like our cheese garlic bread for starters- yes we would...20 minutes later we had to ask where our garlic bread was! It arrived just moments before our steaks!!
Our steaks...well what can I say?
Just the same as our last visit, I asked for medium and my husband medium/well.
They were different cuts to each other but mine was med/well and my husbands medium.
My vegetables were absolutely disgraceful- no one in their right mind would have served them and I hadn't appreciated the mash would be of a 'ready made' variety.
Honestly this was a very poor meal at best and the table next to us complained about poorly cooked food and the people behind them were complaining about poor food!!
We have given Angus a good go and at first we had some super meals here but unfortunately the last couple have been nothing short of disappointing. Needless to say our Angus days are over.",1
"RubbishProbably the worse £80 I've spent on food. Not value for money, burgers were dry, steak nothing special, pay £3 extra for fries to go with the steak as it comes with a salad leaf which a portion from Macs are bigger!! Don't disappoint yourselves go somewhere else!",1
"Pizza is amazing but staff is terrible not worth itI am Italian, from Napoli, just as the owner and most of staff. I have also already written a positive review regarding the food a while ago...I would say I am a usual customer both for the times I’ve been there than for the times I ordered food from Deliveroo..: but now I have to say that when the owner is not there staff is incredibly rude. Got there just now, no reservation for a Friday night, were told that there was no table available if not outside. We decided to go outside and after waiting for 20 mins nobody showed up to take our order. Went inside, asked somebody and the answer was: “we had told you we were busy so now you have to wait, otherwise just go somewhere else”. The problem is not in itself but in the way we have been told, absolutely rude and disgusting; they could have kept us waiting with a drink and a smile but since they were too busy to give us even a bit of water, then we decided to leave. I don’t even know how such rude staff get the chance to get a job somewhere. Ridiculous! Will never be back again, stay away if you don’t want to ruin your night out.",1
"""Great Pizza, Poor Service""very poor service... Bruschetta on my partner's shirt and sort of manager totally rude and very unmannered.
Starting with the incompetence to find our table because the Sir was not able to understand English and to understand where the table was located in the room, continuing with very detestable irony about my chosen pizza, ( I had to request a pizza without mozzarella, as I cannot eat it and I chose olives, sausage and anchovies) and finishing with a bruschetta accidentally on my partner's shirt. No waitress fault as it was an accident, however, the manager's behaviour was totally unacceptable, rude and not able to propose a solution to make the customer comfortable.
result: one oiled shirt, one oiled jacket and only £ 15 discount. No excuses. very bad management",1
"Worst experience ever! Had to call the police.Neither food was good nor service, ended up calling the police. Ordered 5 pasta dishes and a risotto that's what the Italian restaurant specializes in. Sent it back because pasta and rice was undercooked, hard in the middle, almost raw. They said Italian food is supposed to be like that. Everyone is aware of the fact that the best Italian pasta should be a bit hard but not uncooked. Obviously, they knew it was wrong, apologized for a busy time and many customers, cooked a bit more. Second time it was still hard, impossible to eat. We couldn't finish our food. They offered a bottle of prosecco for that and a shot of limoncello. As we found out later they added a bottle of prosecco extra to the bill, cheeky! When we pointed that out, the manager started shouting at us saying ""you took an advantage of us, pay the bill and get the f*** out of this place"". Then tried to punch my friend (a girl) because she pointed out at their mistake. We had to call the police. The owner threw a plate at me because I was standing on the way by accident. Such a disaster!!! Not good food (pasta £15), rude and insulting staff. The worst were the manager and the owner :/",1
"The most awful restaurant I've ever come acrossmmmmm i feel so sorry of having to answer this but i have to and i will!!
1) no one tried to punch any one as you saying but let’s start to explain your table was booked for 10 and you were 11 this is not a problem but would of been better if anyone would of inform as so we would of give a better table .
2) i came to your table 8 minutes after your starter was been taking and your friend beautiful women but very impolite because if any one ask is all ok you do not answer go and check my starter like you are talking to your brother!!
lets say that you did annoyed me but it did not mean much at that stage !!
3) what i was informed by my manager on trial was that the scialatielli was fine but the risotto was to al dente need 2 more minutes of cooking time but the chef because forgotten to start the risotto and when he realized that he made a mistake in rushing the cooking time sorry you were absolutely right it was to hard! all my staff told me the trough the day after and at that stage was to late manager on trial goon and again looking for a competent one !!
4) If they told me at the night i would of remove your entire main even if the filet was fine and you know that! It was medium rare and we have served it medium rare you left the 2 corner and you said that was not.
at that stage i thought that you wanted to take advantage of as and once my manager flipped i was tried to get a better explanation with passion i said what is going on way you are acting like this you had a and you stayed until 11.45 from 8 pleasant night i did not realize that you had all of those trouble and as i said the manager said that the scialatiello was fine they had all the sea food and they left the pasta same the beef was ok only the risotto was a Sirius problem so what i do i remove risotto and give a btl of spumante 1this was his suggestion and i approved and i said as long as they live happy to him but then things went wrong at that stage your friend said the WORD GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY well at that stage i losted then the husband wonted to heat me everybody went a bit wild and i called the police because things went over the stage of return to normality only the police could of stop it!! Were i felt very offended!!
5) i hate all of this and this should of never happen sorry for messing with your 40!
For sure you will never forget about this celebration once we made very special!
6)your offense is past and because i feel bad we are willing to re offer you your celebration free of cost if you want we can discuss a special night for the 11 of that night and will be on as from drink to food so you can understand that we do not want to rip people of and since i have changed the staff I’m having many issue sorry for this inconvenience accident we have been year for 15 years now and i believe if we stayed open in lavender hill there is a reason for it!!
P.s.in this moment of brexit time we all leave a stressful moment and saying to same one go back to your country is a bit to much sorry if i lost my temper on those ward but that is what happen as consequence of it and sorry again for the all negative experience!",1
"TerribleWe visited for the first time for a birthday dinner party, I arrived second to last off 11 people, no staff members came to offer a drink so I had to asked myself. My starter was steam mussels which was ok, my main was fish, again it was ok, wasn't very hot and nothing special with the two dishes, I am a seafood lover and I've had much better experience elsewhere. A few friends had spaghetti with seafood as they have no lobster on the day but spaghetti was uncooked so they have to be sent back but still came back uncooked though the spaghetti itself was a little less ""stiff"" so my friends couldn't finish the dish as it wasn't enjoyable.

Another friend had steak though she was trying to eat it all but she couldn't as she felt the beef was a bit off so she sent it back. The manager appeared rude and raised his voice, saying that she had already ate almost all of her steak but my friend was very polite and explained what went wrong, her steak came back better, it seems she was given a different cut of meat this time. Another friend had a risotto but like most of us, had to sent back as it wasn't very nice but he had never had his food back. Staff were more or less running in the restaurant though it's only a small setting.

At first the manager and the owner seemed nice but turned extremely rude, intimidating, they were screaming on top of their lung, and behaving obnoxiously aggressive. The owner also used the word ""f**k you"" to the group, all was because we questioned the bill. Both the manager and the owner were pushing a male friend of mine against the wall at one point and challenged him, I serious thought they were going to punch my friend so I put myself in-between them. They accused us as being a racist, but most of us in the party are from abroad so the accusation is senseless. One of my friend was started to film on his mobile phone and the owner wasn't happy about this and started swearing. The owner also shouted that he should be charging us for eating our own birthday cake because we were using his plates & cutleries and they have to wash them up.

The situation got out so of hand so we had to call police. The two policemen had to ask the two gentlemen to stop behaving badly several times even in the police's presents.

I've never experienced such things in my life, this restaurant is surely should not be allowed to open for business, it clearly doesn't understand what customer service is, let alone what is good quality food. The manager and the owner are simply have no manners, utterly unprofessional and shameful. Their behaviours were un acceptable to any standards. Our birthday party turned out a nightmare from hell. You customers have been warned.",1

Appalling customer serviceRude staff terrible food and awful timing! We waited over an hour for our main while the rest of the party had been given their dessert menu. Not a true Naples experience.,1
Fake Naples restaurantAppalling service. Booked so our group of 10 was expected but took 40 minutes to get the menu and that was because we asked. Ended up leaving without food as it was taking so long and no orders taken...not even some bread to keep us going and staff not helpful. Very dissapointing as previously visited in a group and had a good time.,1
"Awful...simply very awful...dear Amanda your message to the public is not quite honest at all ,the reason you have left is well different of the way you are saying!!
feerst of all your table was reserved at 8.30 14 guest friday night, well 3 of your guest were spot on and at 8.30 they came respecting the time but the rest of the group came slowly,slowly and the lust 2 walked in at 9.40!! naw by the time you were ready we were to busy to deal with the rest of the 70 customer that turn in before you.
We have tried to explain that we could not take your order at that stage and the 20 menu that we have available were on tables for order to be taken and you need it to wait your turn but you were so rude with un arrogance out of control that you made me loose it telling me that i did not care about my restaurant were i work 90 ours per weak at the moment in order to resolve my problems and you tell me that i do not care and at that stage i was pist off to the stage of asking you to go !
today i feel sorry because i lost many that night we could of make a record of takings with your table but the fact that you reserved at 8.30 and wait for 1 and 15 minutes for all your guest to arrive and expecting as to stop all we doing to serve you it was a bit to pretentious only because you are hungry !
sorry in my house does not work like that we serve special food at high level in a trattoria stile at reasonable price and if you do not respect the time we cannot kip up with our level of service if all of you came in at 8,30 you would of avoided the rusch at 9 that went on until 9,45and we were able to serve you grate food and grate service !! the fact that the guest did not arrive on time has compromise my service and my organization and all we tried to explain was that !! friday we stated at 6 with feerst seating and you were the second seating already and we did third one at 9.40 giving out all our menu, we could not became a menu and you did not understood as at all.
P.s live is based on respect and next time you book a table any were make sure that all of your guest kip the time and not mess with it and you will see that 90%of the cases you are going to have a pleasant night or perhaps we all should be a bit more compressive including myself.",1
Birthday mealCan't rate the food as after an hour had still not ordered. Took 20 minutes for a glass of wine to arrive. Apparently they only have 15 menus. The manager kept saying it was difficult as we were a party of 14. There were only 10 of us. Asking for garlic bread whilst we waited to order sent him completely into a spin. He started shouting & screeching at us and told us to leave. Absolutely shocking. Completely ruined a farewell evening for an amazing colleague. No we are not a group of rowdy youngsters. No we were not drunk. So very disappointed as have been there before & enjoyed great food & atmosphere.,1
Poor staff serviceYesterday went to this bar with my friend to have drinks and some food. When we entered we were told it’s free seating. When we sat ourself then immediately she came to us and said you can’t sit here it’s restaurant and you can’t have drinks. We said we want to eat some food also. She said you won’t get any drink here. Then she moved her other area. We sat then other waiter said you won’t get any food here. Then he moved back to same seat where we sat before. Then other waiter again moved us that it is reserved. All staff confused and not welcoming. We moved 4 times. It became worst experience and no fun at all. It’s disappointing to have bad experience from such kind of popular bars.,1

"Good food not enough of itI was used to be a regular here ,but after what happened tonight I will never come back.
Called to book a table,I was told last seating was 22.15.
Called back after 5 min to let them know I was gonna be 15 min late ,asked if was still possible to have dinner, I was told by the receptionist it was ok .
Arrived there at 22.30 , kitchen was closed so we couldn't eat.
The most annoying thing was the funny faces the four ladies at the reception were doing , like they were making fun of us for arriving at that time .
Such a disappointment",1

"Everything great except food! Food is terrible especially for the priceFood was good, but was promised suckling pig, however got a slither of port belly!!!!!!! Nothing Spanish about the restuarant all at, lacked atmosphere, could be due to it being lunchtime. We had the £30 3 course menu in whch cocktail was included, cocktail was full of ice so about 2 sips of drink. All 3 courses could have been put onto one spoon to give you one decent mouthfull of food. Had the crab to start which came with a few grians of rice, suckling pig was a disastar, with a strip of pork belly, smeared celariac and a crispy artichoke. Dessert was of a good size. With a beer and GnT and bottle of water bill came to £94.00 for a 30 min 3 course meal!",1

"Jobsworth doorman spoiled it before it beganAfter shopping in nearby Oxford street we decided to stop at this bar for a quick drink, as it was a lovely sunny day we thought this roof top bar would be an ideal way to relax for a while. What a horrible experience It was ....security while entering this place aren't friendly, and while we were having our drinks we almost felt they kept on watching us, for what reason I don't know, plenty of indian asian people regularly drink at bars in London. When we went to the bar to order drinks we were served by a very rude arrogant girl ( she had short blonde hair - I think her name maybe Pauline as this was the name on the receipt we were given ) . There was no reason for her to behave in this way as we were polite when ordering. At this point we felt like just walking out, but decided to order as it was getting awkward. We ordered 3 drinks which she very arrogantly prepared and then she added a service charge on the bill, this annoyed me as we had to walk up to the bar and get the drinks, deal with her rude attitude and take them back to our table ourselves, I told her to remove this charge. During ordering drinks there were no pleases or thanks or smiles to be seen from her and the security watching over us made us feel more awkward. We ordered 1 coke, 1 Mojito and 1 beer, the mojito was probably the worst I've tasted. We quickly drank our drinks and left as we did not feel welcome and felt uncomfortable during our whole time here, we would have happily had a few more drinks had we felt welcome and comfortable. I would never return here or go to any other Aqua establishment because if this experience, there are plenty of nicer places in London that are hospitable and are grateful for the customers that walk through their doors. We regularly go to many upmarket bars in London but have never experienced this treatment before. My advice DO NOT spend your money here they don't appreciate their customers ...or it may have just been us that did not fit into their regular clientele....who knows. Shocking !!",1

"Terrible food and customer serviceIf you are going to charge those prices you need decent food to match it. The food was not good! Everything else was great. Food looks good but the chef doesn't understand flavours, it's over complicated and ruins the flavour. Nothing matches.",1

"MediocreOk if you like eating your dinner in a dark disco. Couldn't read the menu it's so dark inside. Food mediocre, i prefer not to visit restaurants where they have a bouncer. Won't return",1

"Nice food but too expensiveI visited with a friend and two children for a cheap and quick lunch. We were offered 20% off the bill outside the restaurant.

It was average food, tasty but nothing special. The bill arrived and it was for £65.

We were shocked and surprised. I would have expected it to cost no more than £35 as that is what I would have paid for it. I had less than half a chicken breast in mine.

The loos were also unisex and smelled badly of male urine.

When my friend complained about the price the staff were extremely argumentative and rude and made a spectacle of us which was very embarrassing.

I would not return here obviously and would urge anyone else not wishing to be ripped off and embarrassed to do the same.",2
"Leaves a lot to be desiredTook us down to basement where we were served by a guy who seemed a bit lost with the whole setup. We had to move tables as our first attempt was practically falling over. The wine arrived and it was nice and warm but not what you'd expect for a white wine. Our table looked into the cold storage room opposite which was constantly being opened and shut by staff walking in and out. Their fridge was broken at the bar and a workman was repairing it around us using electrical tools to get it sorted. There didn't seem to be too much rapport and consideration for customers and a sense that they just wanted your money and then leave.
To be fair the food was fine. No complaints but I would say that the 'fairly hot' is very hot. Reasonably priced but please consider that your food can be good but people do remember all the other things that matter. Look after your customers and consider the environment they are expected to eat in.",2
"OK food, terrible serviceWe had a table of 4 booked for 8pm and brought our own drinks which the staff kindly put in the fridge for us. They then proceeded to open and give us 3 of our beers when we only wanted one, which then could not be put back in the fridge. Later on we asked for our bottle of rose, which had been given away to another table! we were given the house rose....it wasn't great. we ordered poppadoms which took about 20 minutes to come, we eventually ordered our food which then came at 9.20pm, 80minutes after we sat down.",2
DisappointedMaybe the worst service I had in a long time. Our waiter was rude and slow. Went with a group of friends. The food was average and the portions were quite small.,2
Quite not exactly the best indian in UK...All the restaurant in  will claim they are the best in the world...this one said the best in UK. The reality it is not really as good as a medium restaurant in India...but worth exploring  for the ambiance. Once we finsihed we were pushed out as there was a couple waiting to take our seat. Did not really appreciate that.,2
"Lies to get customers inAs American Express card holder I supported and pro-actively participated in 'Shop Small' campaign. As this restaurant advertised acceptance of American Express cards and their participation in the campaign (I double checked with a member of staff at the door), I decided to chose them over many other Indian restaurants in the same street.
I was seated by the door on a very cold day; I repeatedly asked to have the door heater switched on, one member switched it on, the next one came along to turn it off, and it repeated at lest 3 times. The service was slow, no smiles, stern faces, no talk, with rushed 'ready to order' question after 15 min of wait to order. Food was very mediocre, king prawns overcooked and tough, vegetarian option non descriptive, with no specific flavors. When it came to payment they refused to take Amex, I insisted, in the end a senior member of staff took the AXP payment, with a great deal of hardly contained anger. Also charged for 2 drinks (one each for 2 people dining) that were promised to be complimentary during the wait for the table;(a small beer and small glass of wine tasted diluted as watery). I had to ask for those drinks to be taken off the bill, and a member of staff argued with me. It was not difficult to remember I had one drink on arrival while waiting for the table and only one with my meal!
They also lied about their participation in Shop Small campaign, as I never received any notification of the offer being redeemed and no reward received on the card. I will never return and would NOT recommend that restaurant for any customers, especially those who would like to use American Express.",2
"Very Poor CurryVisited with friends, ordered a mixed chicken and vegetable pakora (which was not on the menu but was told a mixed would be no problem) and sizzling chicken curry on the bone, was suggested that I had chopped vegetable with it which I agreed to as it was recommended. I also asked for a hotter sauce with the curry I asked for something like a madras. The pakora was very greasy and no sign of any chicken. The main came, two very small pieces of chicken on the bone, totally covered in a ridiculous amount of chopped vegetables, was very dry with a minimal bland sauce. When I asked if this was the hotter sauce that I ordered I was told not yet before being presented with a tiny bowl of what can only be described as spicy ketchup, I made the point that I had asked for a madras or similar but the waiter was totally disinterested and just walked away. The meal was mediocre at best. When the bill came I pointed out my concerns and noted that the chicken pakora hadn't even been written down on the order. The waiter again showed no concern whatsoever. There are so many great looking places in  I was very disappointed.",2
"Sheba Assuming this is Sheba on , food was ok, toilets are really dirty, service mixed, cab booking after the meal a nightmare",2
"Overpriced for substandard foodWe googled top 5 Indians in bricklane this came in 2nd looking back the review is dated 2014 It might have been that in 1980's but definitely not in 2016 based on our experience.
The alarm bells rang for me as soon as we walked through the door, we we're the only customers there but stupidly we walked in of our own free will.
Any other customers that came in after us were tourist who had been dragged in off the street by a plainly dressed member of staff.
Whilst we ate our meal outside were members of staff from next door constantly spitting and gobbing on the pavement!! (glad we didn't choose that restaurant as I dread to think what their food and service would have been like based on if him spitting all over the street outside their restaurant!!)
Starters
My lamb tikka was dry and the meat looked badly discoloured and rotten looking, it was extremely hot in the middle when I chewed and boy was it chewy? leading me to think it had be microwaved!!
My boyfriend had prawn purée he said his was was ok our other friend had butterfly king prawn he said his was awful.
Our mains were a little better but not by far our food was swimming in oil and my chicken dish was more like Turkey very dry and tasteless. They didn't enjoy their masalas.

We had a taste card so thought it would be cheap how wrong we were? even with 50% off the food bill with 1 drink each the bill was still £78!! I would have died if we were paying full price it left a bitter taste in my mouth even at that!!

Our local Indian I would rate 10/10 this in comparison I'd give it a 2/10

Definitely wouldn't recommend this place.
I think the majority of their business is customers flagged down and dragged in off the street.",2
"We won't be returningHaving chosen this restaurant out of the many in  due to the 50% off deal, I think next time I will choose more wisely. I visited with family for a birthday occasion. The staff were friendly but not particularly attentive when you needed them (although quick to swipe your glass as soon as it reached the table). The standard of food was actually pretty mixed. The chicken in the jalfrezi came out luke warm and was very pink and questionable inside - so much so that my sister was unable to eat it. The potatoes were practically raw and the papadums were not fresh. Some of the other food (such as chicken bhuna) was nice enough but there certainly was nothing that stood out in a positive light. I will add that the jalfrezi was knocked off the bill after we informed them about this but overall the food and service were just not up to scratch.",2

Quite not exactly the best indian in UK...All the restaurant in  will claim they are the best in the world...this one said the best in UK.

When I asked if this was the hotter sauce that I ordered I was told not yet before being presented with a tiny bowl of what can only be described as spicy ketchup, I made the point that I had asked for a madras or similar but the waiter was totally disinterested and just walked away.

The loos were also unisex and smelled badly of male urine.

"A mixed experienceWe booked a table at Bombay Spice last Friday because of good reviews on Tripadvisor. Did it come up to our expectations? Well, the food was all right, and the service was good. Staff members are attentive and service-minded. We got a table in the front room, close to the entrance. Unfortunately, there was a rather noisy party of men in the same room. There were may be 8 or 10 of them at first, but yet more arrived, and they became more and more aloud. In order to be able to have a normal conversation, we had to ask the staff for another table. Our friendly waiter immediately gave us a table in the back room. There we enjoyed our food and had a wonderful time - for about ten minutes. Then another group of approximately 10 men – yes, still exclusively males – arrived and occupied the table next to ours, and they were in drinking mood and shouted and laughed just as loudly as the first group. Again, it became impossible to have a normal conversation. We finished our meal quickly and left.
I am not sure if the staff at Bombay Spice is to blame for a ruined meal. What could they do? But the conclusion of my review is this: Bombay Spice is a wonderful place, given that you are a member of a larger male drinking party.",2
Do not look in the kitchen!Thank your for this review. We are happy you enjoyed our food and service. We hope you visit us again and have a better experience!,2
"Something has gone wrongWe found this place bij TA. While arriving there, a guy try to talk us in. We wanted to walk on, but by the good reviews, we doubtful orded and had dinner. The Tika Masal with Lamb, had not been fresh and tasted tough. Not good, at all. The waiters try to upsell all most everything. By This experience I decided to let go TA review-rates. In my opinion all family of owner and staff modt have overrated this place.",2
"DisappointedThis used to be a fantastic Indian restaurant but on our last two visits , their food has been very disappointing . Don’t no if they changed their chef or what happened but the food quality has gone downhill . Watery butter chicken , saag paneer which had no taste and rice was dry .
This is such a shame and we are not quite sure if we will give them another chance .",2
"Standard Indian, nothing specialI felt we have been treated differently when I ordered the sharing meal, and it is a mistake to drop in this one, not value for money at all.",2
"Food is good, shame about the serviceFood here was okay and nothing more. Jeera kebab starter didn't have a lot of delicacy in its flavour (and was a little dry); Jalfrezi main was a bit flat and mono-dimensional. Given there are so many good curry-houses in London this was disappointing. Prices average, service fine, although I dislike when a service charge is subtly added on to the bill.

Stomach was also uncomfortable the night after, and I eat South Asian food regularly with no problems.",2
Not a great experienceIm not sure how this place got such good reviews. I felt the service was quite pushy and our waiter insisted on highlighting certain drinks because they were the most expensive. It was so obvious! Staff must have been told to do this because all three staff they served us through the evening had the same approach. I felt our waiter was quite rude as well. I was there with a friend and he wouldn't have any issues about approaching out table and mid conversation he would just talk at us. Not just once either. Then the food arrived and It was very disappointing and expensive for what it was. The breadbasket was the best part of the entire meal. Sorry but I wouldn't go back.,2
"The most expensive (mediocre) risotto in London (£38) !!Dear Sharon,

We are very sorry to hear your disappointment in regards to your experience in TOZI. This is absolutely not even close to the standard of service that we always want to provide to our guests. We train our staff to guide our guests and suggest, in order to provide the best experience, we are very sorry if this has been taken in the wrong way. I will mention your points into our daily briefing so that we can improve this.

We would have loved to know your feedbacks about food and service on the night in order to turn the whole experience in the opposite direction.

We hope you will give us a second chance.

Regards

"Very slow bar serviceIt's the second time we went here. I usually don't write 2 reviews but on this occasion, it seems appropriate. We generally enjoyed our meal until the bill came and we saw that the risotto course was £38 - for a medium sized plate of rice and vegetables (no meat). We were offered it as a special (but no price was mentioned). All the other courses were around £6 to £15. This is poor practise. The waitstaff did not handle our complaint well.",2
"Easily ForgettableHello Skippy-rates,

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us, we are sorry to hear that you were not totally satisfied during your second visit in TOZI.

The special Truffle Risotto is always available off the menu and is one of our ""Large to Share"" dishes: it's a bigger portion that can be a main course for two people (£19 per person) or can be also shared between a few diners, it's made with premium ingredients, mainly with Black Truffle from Italy, it's a very generous portion and we believe that the price and the portion is very competitive for Central London,

We always make sure that our waiting staff mention the specials along with the price and the size portion as soon as we approach our guests, we are sorry if this information was not clear, I assume that the complaint did not arrive to the Manager in charge on that day and we apologies for this.

We hope to see you in another occasion.

Regards

"A NOISE BOMBHi Nikolai A,

Thank you for your review,

We always have different bartenders behind the bar taking care of both restaurant and bar orders, we are sorry if you had to wait for your drink order, it is our priority to make sure that guests do not wait too long to be served, it must have been an unfortunate situation, we hope to see you again.

"Overpriced and strange serviceI'm sorry this restaurant does not deserve four and a half stars. Let's start with the good things. The staff were warm friendly and attentive, the decor trendy and the toilets were clean but the food was only palatable. The truth is that this is not a restaurant it's a tapas bar that is noisy like Prezzos. The virgin olive oil served to dip the bread had a bitter after taste and was not really that enjoyable. The zucchini was served on a plate with a napkin which changed colour as the oil drained out and soaked the paper. Aubergine is my favorite vegetable when cooked properly however in the aubergine parmigiani the aubergine had not been grilled before assembly and lacked taste. It was too dry with barely any tomato sauce, no hint of garlic and it was the size of a postage stamp. As for the roast chicken and potatoes I thought it was a quail when it arrived and it didn't go have that sweet flavour of a poussin. The potatoes were just potatoes no rosemary or lemon to bring out the flavour. After that we gave up. None of the dishes were memorable, nothing shouting at you to go back. Lastly I didn't understand why the bill was asking for a gratuity when it already had a service charge? If you were brought up on McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut you'll probably think this place is fab but I think you would get more bang for your buck and more flavour in Zizis.",2
"Not sure if this is the same place as all the 5* reviewsHi Alan,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

We are very sorry to hear you were not totally satisfied about your dinner in TOZI. During the service we always take a lot of care making sure our guests are enjoying their time with us, we would have loved to discover all of the above feedbacks during your stay. The olive oil that we give along with our bread basket comes from Southern Italy. Having a bitter sensation on the tongue it is one of the best indications of a very high quality extra virgin olive, we are sorry to hear that you haven't particularly liked it. One of our biggest aims in TOZI is to follow the tradition and this is what our Chef does with the recipe of the Aubergine Parmigiana, which has been on the menu since the day we opened, nearly 5 years ago. In fact, the aubergines are not grilled but fried, to keep the Parmigiana moisturised and tasty. Our Potatoes are roasted with a lot of Garlic and Rosemary, we don't use any lemon to make them. Lastly, we do not ask any extra gratuity on top of the service charge, what you have probably seen on the bill is for Hotel guests, in case they would like to charge their dinner on the room.

We are sorry if TOZI didn't meet your taste.

Regards

"Other places far better!My friend and I were visiting Tate Britain from University of Southampton in order to see a new exhibition. We decided to treat ourselves to lunch in Tozi, being students, I immediately felt out of place in this restaurant to begin with as it looked to me as though it was mostly work colleagues out for lunch. My lack of comfort was immediately heightened when meeting our waiter who had a strong Italian accent which was difficult to understand. I was reading through the wine menu and found one that I wanted for £5.50 per glass. When I proceeded to show this to him on the menu, he snatched the menu out of my hand and said I have a great one you could try, you want a medium red? He then brought me a taste of the wine he was referring to which I noticed was £11 per glass. I found this extremely rude when I already knew which wine I wanted. The food was absolutely excellent when it came and the £5.50 wine was perfect. When it came to ordering the bill, my friend and I divided up what we had to pay. We weren't sure whether to leave any tip because of the rudeness of the waiter but we said we'd decide after and would just pay the amount that our food came to. When we told him how much money we wanted to put on each card, he tried to work it out in his head and asked us why we weren't paying the 12.5% service charge which we explained we'd pay separately, he then continued by asking what was wrong.

"Superb service -overrated foodI should have listened to other reviewers that warned about the noise level. It was so loud that it made the dinner unpleasant. The food was of good quality.

Not a great experienceIm not sure how this place got such good reviews. I felt the service was quite pushy and our waiter insisted on highlighting certain drinks because they were the most expensive. It was so obvious! Staff must have been told to do this because all three staff they served us through the evening had the same approach. I felt our waiter was quite rude as well. I was there with a friend and he wouldn't have any issues about approaching out table and mid conversation he would just talk at us. Not just once either.

"The most expensive (mediocre) risotto in London (£38) !!Dear Sharon,

We are very sorry to hear your disappointment in regards to your experience in TOZI. This is absolutely not even close to the standard of service that we always want to provide to our guests. We train our staff to guide our guests and suggest, in order to provide the best experience, we are very sorry if this has been taken in the wrong way. I will mention your points into our daily briefing so that we can improve this.

We would have loved to know your feedbacks about food and service on the night in order to turn the whole experience in the opposite direction.

We hope you will give us a second chance.

"Very slow bar serviceIt's the second time we went here. I usually don't write 2 reviews but on this occasion, it seems appropriate. We generally enjoyed our meal until the bill came and we saw that the risotto course was £38 - for a medium sized plate of rice and vegetables (no meat). We were offered it as a special (but no price was mentioned). All the other courses were around £6 to £15. This is poor practise. The waitstaff did not handle our complaint well.",2
"Easily ForgettableHello Skippy-rates,

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us, we are sorry to hear that you were not totally satisfied during your second visit in TOZI.

The special Truffle Risotto is always available off the menu and is one of our ""Large to Share"" dishes: it's a bigger portion that can be a main course for two people (£19 per person) or can be also shared between a few diners, it's made with premium ingredients, mainly with Black Truffle from Italy, it's a very generous portion and we believe that the price and the portion is very competitive for Central London,

We always make sure that our waiting staff mention the specials along with the price and the size portion as soon as we approach our guests, we are sorry if this information was not clear, I assume that the complaint did not arrive to the Manager in charge on that day and we apologies for this.

We hope to see you in another occasion.

"A NOISE BOMBHi Nikolai A,

Thank you for your review,

We always have different bartenders behind the bar taking care of both restaurant and bar orders, we are sorry if you had to wait for your drink order, it is our priority to make sure that guests do not wait too long to be served, it must have been an unfortunate situation, we hope to see you again.

"Overpriced and strange serviceI'm sorry this restaurant does not deserve four and a half stars. Let's start with the good things. The staff were warm friendly and attentive, the decor trendy and the toilets were clean but the food was only palatable. The truth is that this is not a restaurant it's a tapas bar that is noisy like Prezzos. The virgin olive oil served to dip the bread had a bitter after taste and was not really that enjoyable. The zucchini was served on a plate with a napkin which changed colour as the oil drained out and soaked the paper. Aubergine is my favorite vegetable when cooked properly however in the aubergine parmigiani the aubergine had not been grilled before assembly and lacked taste. It was too dry with barely any tomato sauce, no hint of garlic and it was the size of a postage stamp. As for the roast chicken and potatoes I thought it was a quail when it arrived and it didn't go have that sweet flavour of a poussin. The potatoes were just potatoes no rosemary or lemon to bring out the flavour. After that we gave up. None of the dishes were memorable, nothing shouting at you to go back. Lastly I didn't understand why the bill was asking for a gratuity when it already had a service charge? If you were brought up on McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut you'll probably think this place is fab but I think you would get more bang for your buck and more flavour in Zizis.",2
"Not sure if this is the same place as all the 5* reviewsHi Alan,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

We are very sorry to hear you were not totally satisfied about your dinner in TOZI. During the service we always take a lot of care making sure our guests are enjoying their time with us, we would have loved to discover all of the above feedbacks during your stay. The olive oil that we give along with our bread basket comes from Southern Italy. Having a bitter sensation on the tongue it is one of the best indications of a very high quality extra virgin olive, we are sorry to hear that you haven't particularly liked it. One of our biggest aims in TOZI is to follow the tradition and this is what our Chef does with the recipe of the Aubergine Parmigiana, which has been on the menu since the day we opened, nearly 5 years ago. In fact, the aubergines are not grilled but fried, to keep the Parmigiana moisturised and tasty. Our Potatoes are roasted with a lot of Garlic and Rosemary, we don't use any lemon to make them. Lastly, we do not ask any extra gratuity on top of the service charge, what you have probably seen on the bill is for Hotel guests, in case they would like to charge their dinner on the room.

We are sorry if TOZI didn't meet your taste.

"Other places far better!My friend and I were visiting Tate Britain from University of Southampton in order to see a new exhibition. We decided to treat ourselves to lunch in Tozi, being students, I immediately felt out of place in this restaurant to begin with as it looked to me as though it was mostly work colleagues out for lunch. My lack of comfort was immediately heightened when meeting our waiter who had a strong Italian accent which was difficult to understand. I was reading through the wine menu and found one that I wanted for £5.50 per glass. When I proceeded to show this to him on the menu, he snatched the menu out of my hand and said I have a great one you could try, you want a medium red? He then brought me a taste of the wine he was referring to which I noticed was £11 per glass. I found this extremely rude when I already knew which wine I wanted. The food was absolutely excellent when it came and the £5.50 wine was perfect. When it came to ordering the bill, my friend and I divided up what we had to pay. We weren't sure whether to leave any tip because of the rudeness of the waiter but we said we'd decide after and would just pay the amount that our food came to. When we told him how much money we wanted to put on each card, he tried to work it out in his head and asked us why we weren't paying the 12.5% service charge which we explained we'd pay separately, he then continued by asking what was wrong.

"They need to improve a lot!Initially I thought their pricing should imply a level of quality in food and service but it's simply wasn't the case on this visit which was my first.

No card machine I hadn't noticed the age of the sign on the door but seen reviews from February that they have no card machine ... sorry but that's crap service and stinks of some scam in managing their accounts however.....
Service after quick drinks dropped.

Hot day and no chilled drinks we had ask for ice

Just ordering a main course took forever to come luckily my partners order was on a sizzling plate so nice and hot and she enjoyed her fillet steak , my mixed grill was barely warm and came with the wrong sauce.

And we're the staff attentive to check on you ...unfortunately not and as I've given up expecting service I got up to give back the sauce and get the correct sauce sent out.

1/3 of my Luke warm meal was eaten before the sauce was brought out.

Simply put what could have been a positive experience was marred by cold food and poor service against a relatively expensive menu.

This place should be at least 25% cheaper for the demographic they are targeting and at that level they need to be 50% better in service and accuracy and timeliness of delivery.",2
"Service was poor -- the manager did not care1. the starter was the last item to arrive -- after we reminded them
2. no crayons for the kids colouring
3. ordered a well done steak , it was medium rare
4. toilet tap nearly came off in my hand
5. no card machine
6. didn't return the change ( I was going to leave it anyway) however its the principle.
7. out of all the staff there was only one helpful waiter
Need I say more.",2
"Not GoodThe service was above standard however, the steak was small and half of it sinew. It came out cold and buried under sauce and fried onions. Music was to loud and it felt more like a club than a restaurant. Pretty much bog standard and what one could expect from a place like Norbury. Can't say I'm surprised.",2
DisappointingTook my mother out for lunch in Harrow and on a whim thought lets try here. Service was terrible. We had to wait for the staff to finish saying talking to each out before they came to us. Took a long while to finish to get our order due to another conversation and when we did get the food and the drinks both were were slopped on the table. No effect at all to clean it up or to say sorry. Food tasted nothing like how it was describe. It wasn't bad but nothing exciting. Wouldn't eat there again.,2
Third time isn't always a charm.I've been to Steakout on three different occasions and the experience was on a decline with each subsequent visit. I'm a lover of all things beef and was really excited to find a steakhouse with Western style grilling nearby. Obviously my first visit was good since I went back (twice). Unfortunately the quality and texture of the T-bone steaks kept getting worse. They are almost impossible to cut with a sharp knife and since I am not a canine with vampire incisors it was even harder to chew. Sides are just reheated and sauces aren't even room temperature all the way through. I'm sad to say I won't be back for a fourth try.,2
Not impressedWent with high expectations but a serious let Down the starter we got waiting 20 min lamb chops no taste a day buffalo wings which was very nice bit 3 in a portion was a slap in the face for 5.95 then the steaks were covered in the most vile sauce like mustard mixed with horseradish had to scrape it off and use the other chilli sauce given which was nice garlic mash excellent I would not go again,2
"Average food but poor value for moneyWent here for a dinner with friends and while most found the food 'alright', I think it is really poor when considering the money you pay. There are far better alternatives, maybe not in Norbury itself, but the 10min drive down to Croydon. Not suitable if you prefer chicken over beef or if you are looking for good value for money.",2
"SteakoutExpensive, bland and basic, no real taste with little going for it - steaks are tender but lacking in taste, beef burgers very salty with little beef.........is this really halal??? The Woking restaurant was very disappointing.",2
Bad attitude of staffVery disappointed by the bad attitude of some of the staff - very surly and gave the attitude of finding the customers an irritant. Food was not cheap and not exceptional and the unwelcoming environment is unacceptable . Would not recommend.,2
"Didn't match expectationsWent in with partner on Saturday evening. Just not as good as in past visits. Initial 'welcome' and sorting out not really done well. Food was variable, not very good.
Staff audibly arguing and swearing...you just shouldn't allow this anywhere.
Background music not really working effectively. (Probably just needs a better sound system...small point I know).
They've really let things slip.
Will not go back.",2
"disappointing compared to previous visitsWe have been here a number of times over the last five years but unfortunately won't come again unless we think things have picked up. The wild mushroom and butternut squash arancini was OK, but my stuffed courgette main course was laughable. One small to medium-sized overcooked squelchy courgette, the size of a starter, covered with a fairly tasteless cheese and spinach sauce. My partner's mackerel was OK she said, but too salty. Maybe the chef had an off night, or has no idea how to cater for vegetarians. The alternative veggie main course was...gnocchi. Despite the friendly service and the fact that we always like to support our local restaurants, we'll be looking at future reviews to see how other people fare before deciding to go to VK again.",2
"Overpriced for average foodAverage food. Nothing special. Menu stays the same generally with not that much choice and very poor chocies for vegetarians, Not worth no where near what they charge. Service is o.k. If this restaaurant was not in the Village I doubt it would be as succesful.",2
"Am I missing something?We went to the VK a few weeks ago on a Saturday night. When i called they made it sound like they had squeezed us in, however when we arrived we were the only people there for a good hour. Firstly they sat us (in an empty restaurant) at the worst table, at the end of the bar next to the bin. Thats an insult in itself, maybe we looked meek like we wouldnt make a fuss?
When we asked to move they pondered the seating for that night (still empty) and moved us one table along. The speaker was above me with 'War Of The Worlds' blasting out. very relaxing.

Ive worked in bars and there is always something to do but the staff lolled against the bar looking utterly bored which was uncomfortable.

On to the food. We have never been before so we stuck to two staples that you cant go wrong with, steak and chicken. We did have starters that were nice but the staff kept coming over to see if we had finished. I realised this was because the mains were ready and under a heat lamp, I heard the service bell ding. The chicken was okay, dry from the heatlamp but not worse than something you could knock up at home. The steak was more like beef or frying steak, proper chewy, and at £18 a total rip off.

Didnt stay for desert as the bill was already at £75 and I could see the chef in the kitchen chewing his gum (how do you taste anything before it goes out?)

Maybe it was an off night but I darent chance it again. Think I'll stick to EAT17 in future",2
VariableI had a burger here and to be honest it was ok and the drinks were ok too. However my wife had the salmon which looked nice until she tasted it and then turned it over. It had been burnt to a cinder on one side ( not seared but as black as your hat) . Instead of throwing it in the bin as the cook should. It had been served burnt Side down to hide the evidence. My wife also said it had the texture of what she imagined a blackboard rubber would taste like. Someone should tell the cook that if the foods not edible it shouldn't be served. Serving it burnt side down is merely lying to themselves. It's the taste that matters.,2
"Tasteless, tiny portion.I had the chicken and the rib half rack. Which consists of 4 ribs. The chips had no taste, were just warm, you could tell they had been pre cooked and sitting there. The corn was like 5 cm wide and watery. The chicken plain tasteless chicken. The ribs fatty. Even the lemonade was gassy not much lemon taste. The only good thing was the service, the waitress was OK. If never eat here again. Poor quality food, they will probably keep open due to being next to a hotel which means new customers all the time luckily for them.",2
"Facing up to adversityWhat lovely people here! A trial of an evening for them - the grill had given up and so had the kichen extractor fan. The so-called Beefeater engineer was supposedly on his way but did he turn up? Of course not! So the kitchen had to close. But what a thing to deal with. All the staff were helpful, cheerful and kind. Except the manager who was Eastern European and didn’t manage the situation in a British way. The hotel connected to the restaurant was full with people expecting a meal - in a town centre with loads of takeaways there were ways of making the service look helpful like offering for takeaways to be eaten in the restaurant etc. But no, follow the rules and shut down ...

We were lucky, we got food. Prawn cocktails were good, Ribs a bit disappointing as was the fish and chips.

With good ethnic restaurants all around the Woolwich area, Beefeater should try harder here.",2

The waiter was polite, however has not taken much care of his customers. I was not even asked if I was ready for my main, and here it comes, when I havent even touched my starter yet. The duck pate was nice, however the salmon was very dry on the outside, and the green beans didnt taste fresh (very gooey).. After finishing my drink, I wasn't asked if wanted another one..",2

"£43!My friends and I recently visited Sheba on recommendation. We were directed to an upper section with numerous other diners. I suggested to the head waiter that perhaps a downstairs dining experience would be better. This fell on deaf ears, perhaps because they wished for people to see a busy restaurant from outside. The service was ok although we received drinks we did not order. The food was of good quality although I have had better. The issue I have was the value. We paid £43 each including tip. I have never spent that much on a curry before and don’t intend to again.",3
"Mixed feelingsWe chose to eat here based on reviews on here and on the taste card app. The service was good, the restaurant was a little cold but not unbearable.

For food we both had chicken chat puri as a starter which had lovely flavours but was quite greasy, more so than I have experienced in other Indian restaurants. For main courses we had chicken dansak and chicken bhuna. The dansak was delicious and probably one of the best I’ve had, the bhuna was fairly average. We also had a pashwari naan which was not to our liking, purely down to our personal taste as it was much sweeter than expected.

The bill was surprisingly expensive, on paper we should have paid £62 for the above plus pappadums, a coke and a cobra. The bill was reduced to £38 by using a taste card which was much more reasonable.

I’m undecided if I would revisit, the food didn’t impress to the level I expected from the reviews I had read and from the awards the restaurant has received.",3
"The good, the bad and the ugly.I’ve been  before and it’s notoriously competitive with restaurants trying to get your business so make sure you always try and haggle before setting inside. We haggled to get into this restaurant and to be honest it was the trip advisor reviews that made me go in.

We had huge portions of food but it was slightly lacking in flavour, making it slightly boring : We had the chicken Bhuna and chicken shaslik.

I needed the toilet and was upset that they were mixed, I saw a man go to the toilet with the door open which put me off my food a bit! I know that’s not the restaurants fault but they have the space to make the toilets separate.

After that I went upstairs to see the chef bring the bins out through the restaurant (which as this point was at full capacity) and I thought that was such a shame to do as it puts me off visiting again.

Even with the discount you are given at the door it’s still a bit pricey so be wary - they also add on service charge with it not being optional.

My advice is have a lot at the other trip advisor reviews before making a decision to enter into here.",3
"Just averageHi Kelly,

I'm really sorry to hear about your experience at Sheba. Some dishes don't have as strong flavours as others so that we can cater to all tastes but are waiters are very experienced in suggesting dishes so that customers can choose a dish they'll love. Due to space and the building layout are toilets are mixed which is the same for a lot of restaurants along , but we will bare this in mind when we next renovate. When the restaurant is busy our bins do fill up more quickly and rather than keep the rubbish in the kitchen we do prefer to get it out the building for hygiene reasons. We pride ourselves on good food and service so I apologise that this wasn't up to your standards. If you had voiced this to your waiter we would have willingly removed the service charge from the bill.

Many Thanks, Sheba",3
"Recommended at Hotel - No Complaints but Can't Rank as ""Very Good""All very basic. Good service. A tasty simple curry. Clean. gets busy. Nothing special. Well priced for what it is",3
"Disappointed!!!We had a 2 night stay in a hotel at the end of  which contains many Indian / Bengali restaurants - so many that it is difficult to choose where to go. After looking at reviews and talking to reception staff at the hotel we decided to give Sheba a visit. Walking along  is to run the gauntlet of numerous door touts all encouraging you into their establishment with a wide variety of special offers - in truth a pain, and Sheba have thehir man too. We didn't play the game and negotiate any big deal but did get offered a couple of small bottles of Cobra for free which was fine.

The service was prompt and ok. Our orders were produced in a reasonable time and the food was good and tasty if usual curry house fare. I would give a special mention to the naans which were particularly good.

We had hoped for something special or different having looked forward to eating in  restaurants but in truth were disappointed as the food was not different or ""special"" nor better than we have available to us as a daily routine within 10 miles of where we live from many ""Indian"" restaurants

"Good Indian FoodWe attended Sheba for a birthday celebration. Upon entering the restaurant I was immediately happy with the authenticity of the place even the smells were truly lovely. We were seated downstairs as it was a big party.

I ordered the lamb shank which looked awful on the plate and the taste was bland. The orders came in drips and drabs so by the time I got the rice, the lamb was warm. After eating our starters we were told to hold onto our cutlery! Never seen this before - usually cutlery is changed as some people are eating fish and meat!

Ordered diet coke but was flat. The naan was dry and generally, with a party of 25 people, the complaints were all similar with various dishes - just not up to standard.

Avoid at all costs as I am sure, on  there will be a better Indian experience.",3
"Slow, but the food was worth the wait12 of us ate here for a pre Xmas night out. Two things I thought they should have got right from the start

we'd pre booked the table but didn't have enough chairs and tables for us so 2 of us had to stand out the way for 5-10 mins while they sorted it

The meals were pre booked as well but they forgot 2 of the mains and 2 of the sides.

We actually enjoyed the food though and the price is decent.",3
"No complaints about food, service could improveVery busy, the food took a long time to come out to us but when it did arrive it was tasty and good quality. We all enjoyed the meal overall.",3
"Not bad or greatAs stated above, the food was very good so really nothing to gripe about in that department.

What let this restaurant down was the fact that my starter arrived first (obviously) but then 2 minutes later my popadums, and another 3 minutes after that my main. So I had THREE meals on my table. Not content with that, the waiter then proceeded to take away the dips for my popadums, even though quite clearly I still had a couple left.",3
"£43!My friends and I recently visited Sheba on recommendation. We were directed to an upper section with numerous other diners. I suggested to the head waiter that perhaps a downstairs dining experience would be better. This fell on deaf ears, perhaps because they wished for people to see a busy restaurant from outside. The service was ok although we received drinks we did not order. The food was of good quality although I have had better. The issue I have was the value. We paid £43 each including tip. I have never spent that much on a curry before and don’t intend to again.",3
"Mixed feelingsWe chose to eat here based on reviews on here and on the taste card app. The service was good, the restaurant was a little cold but not unbearable.

For food we both had chicken chat puri as a starter which had lovely flavours but was quite greasy, more so than I have experienced in other Indian restaurants. For main courses we had chicken dansak and chicken bhuna. The dansak was delicious and probably one of the best I’ve had, the bhuna was fairly average. We also had a pashwari naan which was not to our liking, purely down to our personal taste as it was much sweeter than expected.

The bill was surprisingly expensive, on paper we should have paid £62 for the above plus pappadums, a coke and a cobra. The bill was reduced to £38 by using a taste card which was much more reasonable.

I’m undecided if I would revisit, the food didn’t impress to the level I expected from the reviews I had read and from the awards the restaurant has received.",3
"The good, the bad and the ugly.I’ve been  before and it’s notoriously competitive with restaurants trying to get your business so make sure you always try and haggle before setting inside. We haggled to get into this restaurant and to be honest it was the trip advisor reviews that made me go in.

We had huge portions of food but it was slightly lacking in flavour, making it slightly boring : We had the chicken Bhuna and chicken shaslik.

I needed the toilet and was upset that they were mixed, I saw a man go to the toilet with the door open which put me off my food a bit! I know that’s not the restaurants fault but they have the space to make the toilets separate.

After that I went upstairs to see the chef bring the bins out through the restaurant (which as this point was at full capacity) and I thought that was such a shame to do as it puts me off visiting again.

Even with the discount you are given at the door it’s still a bit pricey so be wary - they also add on service charge with it not being optional.

My advice is have a lot at the other trip advisor reviews before making a decision to enter into here.",3
"Just averageHi Kelly,

I'm really sorry to hear about your experience at Sheba. Some dishes don't have as strong flavours as others so that we can cater to all tastes but are waiters are very experienced in suggesting dishes so that customers can choose a dish they'll love. Due to space and the building layout are toilets are mixed which is the same for a lot of restaurants along , but we will bare this in mind when we next renovate. When the restaurant is busy our bins do fill up more quickly and rather than keep the rubbish in the kitchen we do prefer to get it out the building for hygiene reasons. We pride ourselves on good food and service so I apologise that this wasn't up to your standards. If you had voiced this to your waiter we would have willingly removed the service charge from the bill.

Many Thanks, Sheba",3

"Disappointed!!!We had a 2 night stay in a hotel at the end of  which contains many Indian / Bengali restaurants - so many that it is difficult to choose where to go. After looking at reviews and talking to reception staff at the hotel we decided to give Sheba a visit.

We didn't play the game and negotiate any big deal but did get offered a couple of small bottles of Cobra for free which was fine.

The service was prompt and ok. Our orders were produced in a reasonable time and the food was good and tasty if usual curry house fare. I would give a special mention to the naans which were particularly good.

"Visit if no other Indian Food restaurant near by youThe food is acceptable, however the service is bad. The servers were having fun and running around among themselves - to that extend that they dropped the roti we had ordered. Though they gave us a new one - it takes time and the food gets cold. Also when we entered they offered us papad - and we thought would be free. When the bill came they billed us 5.6 pounds. On checking with the menu we realised it 0.7 pounds only - asked them why - said the rest is for the pickle, chutney etc..which we never ordered but were served on the table. Now no one charges for chutney and pickle in an Indian restaurant. This is cheating and that too in London. Also the gave us a bill hand written without any VAT etc mentioned on it. Seems they are not paying their taxes either. Also on an earlier occasion - had taken a take away and had ordered an garlic nan - but when we reached home - realised it wasnt there.

Lastly they call themselves Bombay Spice - but frankly they are all not even from India - forget Bombay. - they are misrepresenting Bombay and name of India in London. Also having lived by life in Bombay - the food is not upto the mark what you would get in Bombay",3
"Pretty average Indian foodWe showed up with a reservation and high hopes (due to its ratings). The restaurant didn't know anything about the OpenTable reservation (but confirmed everything in the e-mail from OT indicated that it was for there). They eventually seated us. The food was good, but not any better than many other places. Not sure how their ratings are getting pushed so high. That said, everyone thought their food was good, if not amazing.",3
Not worth moneyThank you for this review. We will take into consideration what you have said in terms of the OpenTable reservation. We are happy to hear you have enjoyed the food! We hope to give you a better experience next time.,3
"Expectations Too HighBeing an Indian I was more keen about vegetarian food but no one suggested me anything about my special veg food requirement. Food is tasty though but way too expensive.

Ambience is okay not very fascinating. Go if you really wanna taste indian spices but never think about being pocket friendly.",3

The service was friendly and efficient, however, we were not blown away by the food. Perhaps our expectations were too high. It was no better than other Indian restaurants we have visited.",3
"A bit LacklustreWe called at last minute to reserve a table. Amazing service, very kind waitress, excellent food, very good range of choices, good location in Marylebone. The interior is not excellent",3
"Very Mediocre Fare,overpricedI order in Bombay Spice with deliveroo, the food was good but nothing special.
They served a very little salad inside a plastic box (not best presentation for delivery). We took as well the mix starter which was very limited (1 vegetarian samosa, 2 pieces of chicken and 1 little piece of lamb). The chicken tikka was good and the chicken korma was the best by far! Everything for £30, as I said, normal.",3
"Great Indian FoodThe food was very tasty, service was ok. But sadly overshadowed by the Gin & Tonics which were warm & we had to ask for ice, there was not enough normal tonic water for a second round, so we had to have slim line tonic which I try to avoid. I would not normally mention such a small detail but for the fact that these 4 G&T's cost us almost £40.00 when the food cost us less. Then when I queried the service charge the waiter mumbled & angrily pointed out that it is normally 12.5%. as if he was doing us a favour. Our table was next to the door and take away orders were constantly in & out so very distracting & annoying.",3
"AverageA modest meal for two which proved mediocre to say the least..in fact I'd say pickles were poor, and Peshwari Naan was poor...main dish only so so.
But the bill was a shock...£46
The same order at our local excellent Indian would have been £28 maximum.
One poppadom each, one Naan between us..one very basic dish each,no coffee , no dessert, one small beer and a spritzer.
We queried the bill...I felt it was far, far too much and really objected to this...he was Charging over £5 for the spritzer...and he'd added £4 .20 service charge that we had no idea about till we scrutinised the bill. Finally we paid the bill minus the service charge and left..
The bill was the sore point that tipped the scales from saying meal was ok..ish...to feeling we'd payed far too much for something that should have been far better.",3
"OK for pre-theatre menuDinner for three cost £100 We had the set meal, which was four small plates to share, plus dessert, four glasses of white wine and one of red, so not bad value
The food was OK : nothing wonderful, but adequate and service was professional

But you would need to eat a la carte to rate the place properly",3

"Nice Italian but lacking somethingWe were looking for a Sunday lunch without the need of pre booking, so we simply walked in at Tozi.
The staff was very kind and they provided the kids with colours and draws, which kept them well busy.
We had a very nice burrata and a freshly made tomato salad.
As a main course, we got the (family style) lobster spaghetti which was also good, but not delicious.
The cocktails were absolutely lovely!
Overall, even though the food was nice, it was missing something, this joint of taste that Italian food has and it is so much wanted!
We will try it again soon for a second chance!",3

"Expensive but unremarkableThis was a nice evening. The style is Italian tapas, and there are a few lovely ones, such as the soft crab and the truffle ravioli.
Overall, however, there are better places. It’s a bit loud and the food is all very nice, but not mind blowing. This said, it’s a cool place with a nice atmosphere (ish) and the espresso left a bit to be desired. The service was very good, and we even received the coffee on the house. I would recommend it, but not as “that Italian” that one absolutely has to go to. But a fun evening.",3

"Good restarurant, poor service.Convenient and easy to get to specially from Victoria tube/station.
It was quite noise when I was there which made it difficult to have a conversation especially when discussing sensitive issues.
The food was good, the large dishes are better than the stuzzichini but it is a little pricy once the 12.5% has been added.
There are not many wines by the glass.
Not sure I'll go back there.",3
"Stylish restaurant but a bit over pricedDear Marie Helen,

Thank you for taking the time to share your review with us, we are very happy you have enjoyed our food. We have 8 red and 8 white wine by the glass, there is quite a discrete choice. The 12.5% discretionary Service Charge is in line with our local competition & generally across Central London. Unfortunately when the restaurant is full it tends to be a bit noisy, we are sorry if this let down your evening.

We hope to see you again in TOZI!

"Miniature portionsTOZI is an attractive space with an elegant, vaguely Art Deco-ish feel and in a nice location on a side street off Vauxhall Bridge Road, near Victoria station. Having looked at the menu in advance, I was excited about my visit as it was full of enticing dishes.

We ordered tuna tartare, fritto misto and a big dish of lobster linguine to share. We were also upsold a small dish of the scallops special. This was actually the weakest of the dishes and particularly disappointing as the upselling was performed somewhat aggressively by the waiter. The lobster linguine was very tasty - as you'd expect for £42 - while the other two dishes were merely 'fine'. Fortunately I resisted yet more attempted upselling - this time of a dessert special - and opted for an affogato which was the highlight of the evening.

Ultimately though, when given a bill of £161 for two (which included service, one of the cheaper bottles of wine and two glasses of prosecco), this was an underwhelming experience, marred by the incessant upselling.

If you're in the mood for upmarket Italian food, I would recommend Bocca di Lupo, which is perhaps a little bit pricier but at least twice as good as this place. Or you could queue up for a table at a branch of Polpo, where the food is superior and cheaper.",3
"Quite pricey and alright food. Good serviceHi Cjm2010_10,

Thank you for your feedback,

We are sorry if you have felt like the waiter was always trying to up sell, this is definitely something that we do not want. The specials from you mentioned were available just on Valentine's day: the Chef and the Bar team created a few specials to celebrate the occasion and we love when there is something new and exciting for our customers to try.

We would have loved to know your feedbacks on the day in order to find some alternatives to the dishes you picked. We don't like to be compared to other restaurants, we think that every place has its own menu and personality.

Please give TOZI another chance, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

"Kichen in the village.I went to this restaurant many times, however my last experience was worst then any others in the past. I don't know why? Perhaps there was a change of kitchen management. I have rated three stars based on my last experience which wasn't so good.",3
"Taken their eye off the ballHave eaten at the Village Kitchen a number of times in the last few years and it has always been a really good meal in really good surroundings. However we've visited for the first time for a while and standards have slipped considerably. The menu lacks the flair it had when Spiros was in the kitchen, and attention to detail has gone completely. To summarise: we had booked a table but when we arrived to a half empty restaurant we got the look around to see if there was a table for us, the fish main course was served with the wrong potatoes and no lemon, sauce for the pudding was grainy and sugary and generally the food wasn't up to the standard that it used to be. We also noticed that a table which hadn't been cleared when we arrived was still unrelated by the time we'd finished our main courses. Also despite the advertised closing time of 9pm we saw customers turned away at 7:30 being to!d that the kitchen is closed. It is sad to see a great restaurant slide down like this, unfortunately we probably won't be going again in a hurry.",3
"Not quite what it wasSuch a shame that the quality of food and service has slipped a little in the last year. It's still good, but no longer truly great. I hope they can bring back the spark of previous years because it has long been our favourite place to eat in the village.",3
"Good foodVisited here for a pre wedding brunch. Really enjoyed the food but the service left a lot to be desired. If it had been busy, the two ladies waiting on would have really struggled to keep up. No table sevice unless prompted either. Hopefully the service can be sorted then it will be a great little place.",3
"Fur coat and no knickers!The food is good, the service excellent but there's just something that niggles me about this place and I think I know what it is. Every business is out there to make money but here the corners cut to boost the bottom line are too, too obvious.

The A board outside heralds a midweek offer - 2 courses for £17! The generosity of this is undermined by its many caveats. The specials aren't included, nor are several items from the menu. I was left unsure of what was actually included. As were the family on the next table, who needed to explain it to each other before ordering.

Our food was good. The Sauvignon Blanc screamed cheap, lacking both body and flavour.

It would be an insult to call Hannah a waitress, she is definitely your host. She seems to be single handedly running the place and does a great job, but there's still only one of her.

I ordered coffee with trepidation. Cost cutting often means bad coffee, but no it was really good.",3
"Limited menu, not the best valueWe visited here a couple of months ago. Whilst the service was faultless, I'm afraid everything else about the restaurant didn't live up to expectations.

The dining area was cramped (we were sat practically in the kitchen) and the menu choice was limited and quite expensive. Typically, when you see such few options on a menu you expect superb quality but that wasn't the case here. In fact, the steak made two of our party quite ill the next day.

There are lots of fantastic restaurants in Walthamstow village and it's a great shame that this one failed to meet the standards of the others.",3
"Good food but overpriced and small portionsWe came here as a group of 4 for some Sunday lunch - we hadn't booked but were told they could seat us as long as they had the table back in 90 minutes, which we had no problem with. They forgot to give us menus, which we had to go and ask for, adding to the delay. The food arrived fairly promptly and was delicious but the portions were small and I thought it was very expensive for what it was. One of our group ordered a sharing platter as a main course and it was paltry - I would have been very disappointed if I had to share it with someone, and it was around £16-£17. The roast dinner was delicious but again, not masses of food though it was done well. We again were not given dessert menus and had to go and ask for them, but decided not to.

The food is delicious but definitely overpriced and the service was quite poor. When we were served they were very nice and apologetic so I don't necessarily blame the staff but it didn't seem that busy and asking for menus twice is a pretty big no-no in my book and we didn't feel valued as customers. Based on the food alone I would eat there again but based on price there are better value restaurants in the village.",3
"Reasonable food but way overpricedMy wife and I have moved to E17 recently and decided to check out The Village Kitchen and, I have to say, it's a bit of a disppointment.

Overall the food was tasty enough (with the exception of my utterly flavourless Bombay potatoes) but the portion sizes were mean and quality of ingredients didn't make up for it. Everything we tried was way too expensive for what it was. The irony is that if they'd charged £2 a dish less we probably would have stayed for dessert and spent more money.

It's worth adding that we were put next to the bar and the noisy dishwasher behind it and assumed it was because we'd booked late in the and the restaurant would get busy. It didn't.

Overall, an okay meal but there are loads of places I'll try in Walthamstow before thinking of coming back.",3
"This restaurant in Walthamstow Village could do better.......My son and his girlfriend took me here after work one evening. The restaurant was very busy for a Wednesday night.

We shared two starters which was a Greek Meze and fried calamari. These were very nice. My sons girlfriend had halibut which was slightly overcooked, my son had steak which was ok, My main course was ok.. We shared two deserts of creme broullette and chocolate cake. These were very good.

We had a bottle of new zealand sauvingon blanc and two additional glasses of red wine. Plus a couple of coffees.

Service was average. This restaurant could do better, with a little effort.

The bill came to £107.00, which I thought was quite expensive for the meal we had.",3
"Wasn't impressed...I moved from Walthamstow when I was 25 having lived there all of my life. The Village is therefore a place I know very well - my parents still live nearby.

Given the strides forward the Village area has made in recent years, we decided to visit for lunch on Saturday.

After a quick comparison between the Village Kitchen and Eat17 menus, we settled on the former, drawn particularly by the tasty-sounding all day breakfast.

A warm welcome and a relaxed, if a little dark, atmosphere greeted us, which was a good start.

Having ordered the breakfast (though this was at
lunchtime) we settled back with our drinks in hungry antipiciation.

After a too-good-to-be-true short time our food arrived. First impressions - chic. However, to my disappointment, chic did not translate to tasty or quality or...worth it.

The serving was small, whuch could be forgiven if the food was amazing - it was not. One rasher of bacon was clearly pre-cooked, nearing cold and dry. Ditto the one sausage. Best quality award went to the baked beans, which frankly is saying something. The price didn't help this go down any better either...

Overall, ideal location, excellent opportunity ti thrive, chic design and apporach but lacking that key factor that sets the best food establishments from the rest...decent food. A shame.",3
"Great curry nightMy friend and I came here one evening, both with a huge curry craving that had been around for a week. We came here on a recommendation of a friend which is always useful when you're in  amongst a huge amount of Indian restaurants.

This was definitely one of the better meals I've had and we left very happy, craving satisfied!

We got a few different things to share including tandoori lamb chops, salmon tikka and special chicken shashlik masala. Some pilau rice, sag aloo to accompany. It was delicious, all of it. One of those meals where we got stuck in and hoovered it up. Moorish and delicious.

Uncomplicated restaurant, very much in style with a lot of the  restaurants. Washed down with a couple of beers. Nice service (although there was a domestic of some sort with two of the waiters nearly coming to blows!).

Would happily return for curry night.",4

We had a loverly meal, staff where informed and helfull when we asked questions about the menu. We brought our own bottle and this was allowed evan thought we discovered they do sell drinks. Over all a very nice meal, good value and staff extremely helpful and nice. Will again m",4
"Great curry with friendly serviceWe popped in on a quiet Monday evening, not many diners, the food was flavourful. We ordered poppadoms, starters and shared the special tandoori King prawn korai with aloo gobi, rice and naan. Portions were generous, prices are reasonable and in line with the many curry houses in the area

The restaurant has a drinks license but I was able to BYO which is a plus",4
Good food but very cramped insideFood here was good but the overall experience was spoiled by the proximity to other tables and how they shoehorn people in here. As will all  curry houses you will be accosted by a tout who will claim to have the chef of the year (how many chefs of the year can there be ?) he also was very proud to show us an article in the window regarding a visit that Ainsley Harriott made there ( 10 years ago) ! He never said whether Ainsley enjoyed it though :-) we both really enjoyed our meal but were sat practically on the lap of another drunken diner whose only volume was 10. A little bit more room would have made this a 5 star review.,4
"Attentive service, lovely, filling food.My friend and I were very hungry after a long day of not eating much, so we stumbled across this restaurant in, . We were offered 25% off of our meal and free soft drinks upon arrival. The restaurants atmosphere was nice, and the service was very much attentive and very polite. The servers really attended to my vegan friends needs, so it's very vegan friendly here, and the food was very nice. I haven't had chapati in a while, so I was SOOO excited to see it on the menu here, it was lovely. We were overly satisfied and full by the end of the meal. The bill wasn't too expensive and we didn't mind the service charge, as they did deserve it; I would have tipped more if I had any change.",4
"Excellent valueManaged to haggle down an 8 person meal (starter/main/rice/naan/2 pints) for £12 each. Ended up with service charge paying 15 each but still worth it - (even though we did see one of our pints come from a carlsberg can). Food was good, Rogan Josh was flavourful if a little greasy and the naan was excellent.

Considering how much I paid, I highly recommend - if I had to pay full price, maybe not...",4
"Nice Indian Restaurant on .I generally don't go looking for Indian food, but when in London (or the UK) it is almost criminal not to experience it. And London does excellent Indian food. I have been to Sheba twice, once with friends and once with family. I have enjoyed my food both times, as well as the people who have been dining with me. I had wine one time, which I would not recommend.

The decor is nice and the staff attentive. There is the added plus that Sheba is on , and therefore you have the perfect opportunity to explore some truely fabulous street art!

I highly recommend Sheba.",4
"An enjoyable meal at a good priceHi Jennifer, thanks for your review, we are glad you enjoyed the food and would recommend us. Hope to see you again when you are back in town!",4

The food was lovely and for £15 per head you really cannot go wrong. Attentive quick service without being pushy.

Would visit again.

Why not 5*? My only minor criticism was that the decor was looking a little tired, but that did not particularly detract from the overall experience.",4

"Attentive service, lovely, filling food.My friend and I were very hungry after a long day of not eating much, so we stumbled across this restaurant in, . We were offered 25% off of our meal and free soft drinks upon arrival. The restaurants atmosphere was nice, and the service was very much attentive and very polite. The servers really attended to my vegan friends needs, so it's very vegan friendly here, and the food was very nice. I haven't had chapati in a while, so I was SOOO excited to see it on the menu here, it was lovely. We were overly satisfied and full by the end of the meal. The bill wasn't too expensive and we didn't mind the service charge, as they did deserve it; I would have tipped more if I had any change.",4
"Excellent valueManaged to haggle down an 8 person meal (starter/main/rice/naan/2 pints) for £12 each. Ended up with service charge paying 15 each but still worth it - (even though we did see one of our pints come from a carlsberg can). Food was good, Rogan Josh was flavourful if a little greasy and the naan was excellent.

Considering how much I paid, I highly recommend - if I had to pay full price, maybe not...",4
"Nice Indian Restaurant on .I generally don't go looking for Indian food, but when in London (or the UK) it is almost criminal not to experience it. And London does excellent Indian food. I have been to Sheba twice, once with friends and once with family. I have enjoyed my food both times, as well as the people who have been dining with me. I had wine one time, which I would not recommend.

The decor is nice and the staff attentive. There is the added plus that Sheba is on , and therefore you have the perfect opportunity to explore some truely fabulous street art!

I highly recommend Sheba.",4
"An enjoyable meal at a good priceHi Jennifer, thanks for your review, we are glad you enjoyed the food and would recommend us. Hope to see you again when you are back in town!",4
"Good dealAfter running the gauntlet of  we were approached by a tout offering us a starter, main, rice and naan all for £15 including a free beer. This seemed very reasonable and so we agreed and were taken to our table.

The food was lovely and for £15 per head you really cannot go wrong. Attentive quick service without being pushy.

Would visit again.

Why not 5*? My only minor criticism was that the decor was looking a little tired, but that did not particularly detract from the overall experience.",4
Frequent customer to the best restaurant in Thanks for your review. Hope you come back for more curries at Sheba :),4
"Great curry nightMy friend and I came here one evening, both with a huge curry craving that had been around for a week. We came here on a recommendation of a friend which is always useful when you're in  amongst a huge amount of Indian restaurants.

This was definitely one of the better meals I've had and we left very happy, craving satisfied!

We got a few different things to share including tandoori lamb chops, salmon tikka and special chicken shashlik masala. Some pilau rice, sag aloo to accompany. It was delicious, all of it. One of those meals where we got stuck in and hoovered it up. Moorish and delicious.

Uncomplicated restaurant, very much in style with a lot of the  restaurants. Washed down with a couple of beers. Nice service (although there was a domestic of some sort with two of the waiters nearly coming to blows!).

Would happily return for curry night.",4
"Friday night celebrationI did not find trip advisor helping when looking for a restaurant in  and finally settled on Sheba. We had a loverly meal, staff where informed and helfull when we asked questions about the menu. We brought our own bottle and this was allowed evan thought we discovered they do sell drinks. Over all a very nice meal, good value and staff extremely helpful and nice. Will again m",4
"Great curry with friendly serviceWe popped in on a quiet Monday evening, not many diners, the food was flavourful. We ordered poppadoms, starters and shared the special tandoori King prawn korai with aloo gobi, rice and naan. Portions were generous, prices are reasonable and in line with the many curry houses in the area

The restaurant has a drinks license but I was able to BYO which is a plus",4
Good food but very cramped insideFood here was good but the overall experience was spoiled by the proximity to other tables and how they shoehorn people in here. As will all  curry houses you will be accosted by a tout who will claim to have the chef of the year (how many chefs of the year can there be ?) he also was very proud to show us an article in the window regarding a visit that Ainsley Harriott made there ( 10 years ago) !

"Good Curry !Went here based on reviews and they were pretty accurate ... good tasty curry, nice service, and decent prices for ""that there London"".
Staff were attentive, and serviced well .. busy for a Wednesday night, so no complaints ... i would be happy to go back.",4
"Wonderful!Really good food and amazing service! The staff put together several dishes for our family to share, which was a great taste experience and allowed us to taste a lot of different plates. We highly recommend this restaurant!",4
affordable anddeliciousi have visited so many place in central london which are quite expensive.first of all you get find asian food there very often. i saw this place when i was passing by and stopped to buy some food. it was very delicious and mouth watering.,4
"Refuge in a BlizzardWe were stranded in Marylebone in the middle of a stowstorm and seeing the lights of The Bombay Spice between the snowflakes we dived straight in. They were busy despite the weather and seemed to have a full compliment of staff. The service was fast and attentive and the food delicious. If we are ever in that area again, we will certainly go back.",4
"Good Indian restaurant near Baker StreetWent to Bombay Spice for dinner.

One had king prawn butterfly £6.25 to start.

For mains we had chicken chilli stir fry £11.95, half tandoori chicken £8.25 with side dish of bhindi bhaji (okra) £4.75, pilau rice £2.60 and a garlic naan £3.15. The tandoori chicken was very succulent.

With a bottle of red wine £24.95 and sparkling water the bill for two including service came to £72.

The food was good and service also.",4
"Great Indian restaurant!Fantastic place to go to for superb Indian food. Great atmosphere and the staff are all very friendly, but it is a little on the expensive side. Overall, if your in the area and you love Indian food, this is the place to go!",4
Lovely IndianThank you for such a great review of your experience at Bombay Spice! We hope to see you around again.,4
Great foodThis place is a hidden gem - we had the thali (meat option) and the food was absolutely spot on ! Service wonderful - they just couldn’t do enough - I would certainly return here and highly recommend this place.,4
Tasty!Thank you this lovely review. Extremely pleased to hear you enjoyed the Thali and the service. We look forward to seeing you again!,4
"Cold night, great curry, excellent service but..Well what can I say what a lovely meal not to spicy we thought, but boy it was spicy a very good place if you like spicy food, and as it was only around the corner from our hotel it was in an excellent location. Really recommend this resturant",4
"Good for Sunday lunchI have been here several times and, for us, it’s Sunday lunchtime that works best. Big open airy room, good service - our waitress guided us to a delicious but not horrendously expensive wine (necessary with four women who enjoy their wine) Food is generally very good - lots of Italian small plates that accomodate everyone’s palate. I particularly liked the fried zucchini and buffalo mozzarella.
We will be returning",4
"Meal before the theatreLoved the food. You can order tapas size dishes which is perfect for both myself and my daughter. However, the downside was that all the dishes came out at different times. we ordered 5 dishes for 3 of us to share but by the time they all arrived, some were beginning to go cold and we were on a time restraint. The food we had was really tasty and would order again if and when we go back to Victoria",4
"Really niceThe food was all amazing, the atmosphere was great, and the staff were all friendly. Highly recommended.",4
"Good food and atmosphereEarly in the evening we had called into Tozi as a group of five before going to one of the nearby theatres. The restaurant offers small Venetian style “Chiccetti” although larger plates are also available. We sampled a variety of meats, octopus, salad with some nice bread and a bottle of prosecco. All service promptly and in a friendly manner. Tozi is a good option if you are in the Victoria area and need a meal in an elegant and nice space.",4
"Very nice atmosphere and foodThe restaurant has a very nice atmosphere, great service and the food is fabulous!
Only things that lead to deducting one star is: the wines are only Italian (which I like, but other countries should be present here as well like Chile).
Tip: as a dessert try the pistachio tiramisu. Is with real mascarpone and the taste is superb (although it isn’t anymore a Venecian dish).

Surely will come back.",4
"VERY BUZZYDear Andres,

Thank you for taking the time to share your TOZI experience with us, We are glad you've found our food of high quality and a very welcoming and Italian atmosphere.

Happy to hear your overall experience was successful. We agree with you on the fact that other countries have amazing wines, but as we are an Italian restaurant we have decided to support small Italian wineries as well as well known producers.

We all look forward to have you again here for another occasion.

Tip: as a dessert try the pistachio tiramisu. Is with real mascarpone and the taste is superb (although it isn’t anymore a Venecian dish).

"VERY BUZZYDear Andres,

Thank you for taking the time to share your TOZI experience with us, We are glad you've found our food of high quality and a very welcoming and Italian atmosphere.

We all look forward to have you again here for another occasion.

"Good for Sunday lunchI have been here several times and, for us, it’s Sunday lunchtime that works best. Big open airy room, good service - our waitress guided us to a delicious but not horrendously expensive wine (necessary with four women who enjoy their wine) Food is generally very good - lots of Italian small plates that accomodate everyone’s palate. I particularly liked the fried zucchini and buffalo mozzarella.
We will be returning",4
"Meal before the theatreLoved the food. You can order tapas size dishes which is perfect for both myself and my daughter. However, the downside was that all the dishes came out at different times. we ordered 5 dishes for 3 of us to share but by the time they all arrived, some were beginning to go cold and we were on a time restraint. The food we had was really tasty and would order again if and when we go back to Victoria",4
"Really niceThe food was all amazing, the atmosphere was great, and the staff were all friendly. Highly recommended.",4
"Good food and atmosphereEarly in the evening we had called into Tozi as a group of five before going to one of the nearby theatres. The restaurant offers small Venetian style “Chiccetti” although larger plates are also available. We sampled a variety of meats, octopus, salad with some nice bread and a bottle of prosecco. All service promptly and in a friendly manner. Tozi is a good option if you are in the Victoria area and need a meal in an elegant and nice space.",4

"Traditional, Friendly Tapas RestaurantBar 61 is a traditional tapas restaurant with the most amazing service. There is a wide range of food and wine and plates are very generous in size. The service is absolutely brilliant, the managers are very friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and ‘part of the family’. Highly recommend as the best tapas in Streatham!",5
"Anniversary DinnerLovely dinning experience of many delicious tapas. Our service was exceptional and entertaining. It was our first visit to London, so happy we discovered Bar 61. We would recommend to all. Well done gentlemen!",5
"Another lovely eveningSecond visit here that reconfirmed it as one of my new favourite local spots. Great food, good atmosphere and charming, attentive waiting staff.",5

"Excellent atmosphere and friendly service with delicious food.6 of us had dinner here to celebrate a 61st birthday - after the main course the management put on birthday music, and we were all presented with fruit and liqueurs on the house. We started with a selection of tapas between us and followed with a main course - all the dishes we tried were delicious and the service most attentive and friendly. We were most impressed and will come back again.",5
Wonderful placeWas treated to an evening here for a special occasion. Hugely welcoming team and an amazing menu. Nothing is too much trouble - truly excellent service. Very tasty tapas dishes and drinks. A real gem. Thank you guys!,5
Yummy and deliciousI arrived at approximately 815pm. I was given a clean and comfortable table.Food arrived swiftly..... great! Speedy and polite service and very very tasty.,5
Nice timeWas great and the waiter was great we enjoyed our meal we had the fish and also the beef we loved the food.,5
Dinner5 star service! We had an amazing time and an amazing dinner! We will definately be returning again!,5
"Wanted a “” curry & that’s exactly what we got!So we’d promised ourselves a curry in  and couldn’t hv been happier to end up at Sheba. The staff were lovely and friendly and did us a great deal. Can’t fault the cuisine, plenty of variety from your usuals to some specialities (village handi chicken was superb). Can’t wait to return later this year.",5
"Just greatWell...I liked it a lot. Very good food. I tried quite a few things, and everything was superb. Best curry chicken I've had ever. Totally recommend it.",5
Superb9 of us arrived last night (5 children and 4 adults). The food was superb and the children were really well looked after. Seriously good value for money and my daughter actually said it was just as good as our favourite Indian at home. The management gave all the children free puddings. The food tasted absolutely delicious and we will be going back to our favourite  Indian as soon as possible!!! Definitely the best Indian we’ve had for a long time! Yum yum yum!!!!! Chicken tikka massala is good and the keema nan delicious!!!,5
Bloody FantasticIt was a cold dark night in a snowy London and my belly was rumbling. So I wander down  and I come across a little gem called Sheba. I am welcomed with smiles and shown to my table. The food was amazing and the price was too. This is by far the best Curry outside of India and Abbas who served me was a bloody good chap. I highly recommend this restaurant.,5
"Best I've had!Taken here by son and DIL who live in London and eat out regularly. We loved this place. Food was fantastic and we chose many different dishes that were not too large, so we could share. We often over-order, but the portions were just right here.
Friendly, efficient service.",5

"Better than mostWe are regular  visitors looking for a lunch time curry. Chose Sheba as there was no touting , it was busy and the staff were very efficient. The lunch time special was more expensive than others close by but the menu was very different from the usual fare. We both had a delicious curry. Portions are very large and we needed a long walk home after lunch!

Can’t fault the cuisine, plenty of variety from your usuals to some specialities (village handi chicken was superb). Can’t wait to return later this year.",5

Superb9 of us arrived last night (5 children and 4 adults). The food was superb and the children were really well looked after. Seriously good value for money and my daughter actually said it was just as good as our favourite Indian at home. The management gave all the children free puddings. The food tasted absolutely delicious and we will be going back to our favourite  Indian as soon as possible!!! Definitely the best Indian we’ve had for a long time! Yum yum yum!!!!! Chicken tikka massala is good and the keema nan delicious!!!,5
Bloody FantasticIt was a cold dark night in a snowy London and my belly was rumbling. So I wander down  and I come across a little gem called Sheba. I am welcomed with smiles and shown to my table. The food was amazing and the price was too. This is by far the best Curry outside of India and Abbas who served me was a bloody good chap. I highly recommend this restaurant.,5
"Best I've had!Taken here by son and DIL who live in London and eat out regularly. We loved this place. Food was fantastic and we chose many different dishes that were not too large, so we could share. We often over-order, but the portions were just right here.

"£43!My friends and I recently visited Sheba on recommendation. We were directed to an upper section with numerous other diners. I suggested to the head waiter that perhaps a downstairs dining experience would be better. This fell on deaf ears, perhaps because they wished for people to see a busy restaurant from outside. The service was ok although we received drinks we did not order. The food was of good quality although I have had better. The issue I have was the value. We paid £43 each including tip. I have never spent that much on a curry before and don’t intend to again.",5

"Great curry nightMy friend and I came here one evening, both with a huge curry craving that had been around for a week. We came here on a recommendation of a friend which is always useful when you're in  amongst a huge amount of Indian restaurants.

This was definitely one of the better meals I've had and we left very happy, craving satisfied!

We got a few different things to share including tandoori lamb chops, salmon tikka and special chicken shashlik masala. Some pilau rice, sag aloo to accompany. It was delicious, all of it. One of those meals where we got stuck in and hoovered it up. Moorish and delicious.

Uncomplicated restaurant, very much in style with a lot of the  restaurants. Washed down with a couple of beers. Nice service (although there was a domestic of some sort with two of the waiters nearly coming to blows!).

Would happily return for curry night.",5
"Friday night celebrationI did not find trip advisor helping when looking for a restaurant in  and finally settled on Sheba.

"HOOKEDBest seafood I’ve had in London! Great intimate setting, delicious food. We had a fantastic date night! Thank you so much! Will be returning!",5
"Great seafood, intimate relaxed atmosphereI did some research on restaurants before arriving in London. I am traveling here with my wife and three daughters from the states, and I was looking for an intimate seafood place that would be high quality and not fussy. It was our anniversary and we left the kids at the hotel. This place fit the bill perfectly. The dining area is small, and cozy, although it looks like they are set for an expansion. The menu is fairly straightforward and based on what’s fresh and available. The kitchen is in view and tight looking - but they are producing excellent food -We enjoyed everything. The fresh oysters were top notch, while whole grilled sardines in a Mediterranean preparation were amazing as was the sea bream and hake. We saw several diners enjoying whole chilled crabs which looked to be pretty incredible also. The servers were attentive and fun to chat with. When you make your reservation, they do ask the table to turn about two hours on from when you’re seated which I think is reasonable, but be prepared for this when making the reservation. All in all a great spot for a high quality, intimate seafood dinner.",5
"Lovely people, lovely foodThe food here was INCREDIBLE andd the staff were lovely and vertly happy to give advice, despite how busy it was. Would definitely recommend",5
I will come again.How great to visit a small place that has the feel of visiting good friends. Their oysters are amazing.,5
"Excellent seafood, great staff, reasonable pricesA must go for anyone in Covent Garden area.

A small restaurant that serves excellent seafood with top service staff such as Helen. She took care of us really well and her recommendations for the dishes were all great!

We spent about 120 pounds for 3 pax including a bottle of champagne which I think it's really worth it.

Will love to go back again on my next trip to London!",5
"Really coolHow great to visit a small place that has the feel of visiting good friends and at the same time really knows what they are talking about! We had different oysters, four different kind, and the waiter described them for us. It’s the first time that I really understood the different taste and textures of the little creatures. Perfect champagne to go with it is a plus. Would visit again!",5
"THE best food in ages - now my number 1We try so hard to find decent food and this totally lived up to the reviews, deliciously simply dishes, crab, plaice, oysters - these guys bought Dorset to the city 😃",5
"first class seafoodAs always with my reviews it is based on value for money. £104 for 2 including tip.
My wife and I had, half a dozen oysters and anchovy toast as starters, my wife then had a 1.2kg crab. Well cooked and presented, with all the necessary tools!

I had the whole plaice with peas and chilli. (if I'm being fussy a bit much chili perhaps?), along with a baby gem lettuce salad and chips.
We shared a bottle of the very nice house Spanish white, which we had plenty of when touring northern spain last year, - we thought why pay more? Certainly not with chilli on my dish.

Very friendly efficient service, the price included the 'London 12.5% tax'. Which on this occasion I did not ask to be removed despite it being 2.5% too much even for excellent service, but all too ubiquitous I know.


Still a 5 out of 5 though.",5
"Outstanding food, easy-going service and low key atmosphereTop class fish and shellfish cooked to perfection. Atmosphere is relaxed and decor is low key: don't be deceived- you're getting truly outstanding food here, just without the silver service. Good banter with the friendly young lads waiting tables. A great experience all round. Affordable decent glug of house wine, too.",5
"The best meal I’ve ever had!I took my Mum for lunch at The Oystermen after reading the reviews on trip advisor and the restaurant certainly lived up to expectations! From entering the restaurant the service was fantastic - polite, personable and efficient.

We started with oysters which were to die for, paired with pink fizz from France which was equally as delicious. We then had an amazing main - trout for my Mum and sea bream for myself. I could still taste the delicious flavours hours later and I’m already planning my next visit! Thank you for a delicious meal, which as noted in my title of the review was probably the best meal I’ve ever had!",5

Best butter chicken in LondonI came here for a random dinner and ate the best butter chicken of my short life. The staff are so kind and every dish on the menu is divine!,5

"Excellent fantubulous must goHi
We were with the kids last night for the dinner at Bombay Spice. Came from a long tour @. Warner bros., the kids were really hungry. While we were headed back to our apartment, we saw this eye catching name.. Bombay Spice written on Paddington street. Quite dilemmatic as we felt, we went inside the restaurant and ordered kadhai paneer, tandoori chicken and chana masala alongwith rotis to go. The food it came was sizzling hot as we wanted and absolutely delicious. While the kids loved tandoori chicken, we almost overeated with the sumptuous kadhai paneer and chana masala. The staff was so nice to provide us chopped opion, pickles, the traditional green chutney of Delhi to make us feel totally in our hometown. Last but not the least, the dinner ended with our favourite chocolate after eight which they provided as a mouth freshner after the meal.
In short, an excellent restaurant with courteous staff. Would highly recommend!!",5
"An Indian Dinner to rememberWe were only in London for a few days, and just happened to find the Bombay Spice near our hotel. Fantastic food - we had three Chef’s Specials and a Paneer Kulcha naan, with generous servings. Highly recommended!",5
"Home deliveryOnly 3 words to describe the food we had delivered: Delicious. Amazing. Perfect.
We used to live in a Indian area in southwest London and lived the restaurants there but trying Bombay Spice was an amazing experience and we truly loved the amazing taste and quality of their authentic kitchen. Many many thanks :)",5
"Absolutely deliciousWe have never been disappointed by this place in two years. Our regular go to when we fancy some traditional Indian food. Good quality/quantity for price!

The staff is also really lovely and so is the atmosphere. Nothing fancy just a place we love to go to regularely!

Would definitely recomend:
- Butter Chicken
- Lamb Paka
- Naans",5
"Anniversary tripWe were staying at the hotel where Tozi is located. We decided to have dinner there on our last night. I'm so glad we did. The food and service were excellent. We had the large rib of beef to share. I highly recommended it. We also shared asparagus fritti, spinach, and calamari. For dessert we had a wonderful pistachio tiramisu and ice cream.
I will recommend Tozi to my friends and family when they visit London. If we get a chance to vacation in London again we will make sure to return to Tozi.",5
"What an experience.I took my Mum here for a meal before we went to the theatre. We were welcomed by extremely friendly staff which carried on through the duration of our meal. We were made to feel welcome throughout. It was nice to be able to see the kitchen as the chefs worked away. I wish I could say what my favourite dish was, however every dish we had was presented beautifully and tasted fantastic. The flavours in all the dishes were combined perfectly. My mum enjoyed it as much as I did. This is top food with at a very reasonable price. Money and time well spent eating here. We shall be returning. Thank you!",5
"Interesting, delicious foodDear Ellewell66,

Thank you for the time taken to share your experience with us, we couldn't be happier reading your beautiful words! We are glad you decided to visit us before heading to the theatre and to hear that you have enjoyed all the Cicchetti from you chosen and that the service was also up to standard.

We all look forward to welcome you again soon in TOZI for another remarkable experience.

Grazie Mille!

"DeliciousChose Tozi based on Trip Advisor reviews for dinner on a Sunday evening and it was close to our hotel. Everything about it is good - nice surroundings, excellent, friendly service and really interesting food - Italian tapas-size (but generous) portions, made from really fresh, good quality ingredients. We started with bruschetta and pizzetta to share, then a lovely avocado and radish salad with wonderful pasta with asparagus and truffle, then veal saltimbocca and lamb chops. Don't know how we found room but we shared the best pannacotta we have ever tasted. We were recommended 3 - 4 dishes each to share and had six between us (not counting dessert!) but 4-5 would have been enough. Really good to find a quality Italian restaurant with portions this size, highly recommended!",5
"Best PastaCiao Scillyfan!

Thank you very much for sharing such nice compliments and positive ratings about the Tozi Experience you had with us.

We're very happy you have enjoyed everything, from the tagliolini with truffle to the pannacotta.

I'll make sure to pass your kind comments to the rest of the Team, that would love greeting you once more at Tozi for another remarkable experience!

A presto, ",5
"DinnerFresh and tasty food. We had three different salads which were surprisingly filling - crab salad was lovely. Finished with the panacotta and had a lovely meal. Staff are all friendly and chatty. While this is not a cheap eat, it is worth it.",5

"Dinner visitOur first trip to London, and this was easily the best food we ate while there. But not only was the food fantastic, the ""Hand cut tagliolini, asparagus & black truffle"" was the BEST PASTA WE'VE EVER HAD.
Listen I might be slightly exaggerating...maybe it's the second-best pasta I've had in my entire lift... but it was sooo good... and to boot, the service was friendly and timely, the restaurant was lovely, and it was a great Italian restaurant in central London. All this together for sure makes it best pasta ever.
And don't get me started on the pistachio tiramisu---that was another fantastic dish!
The only downside is that it was quite a pricey meal when it was all done, but the prices are certainly fair when contrasted to similar restaurants.
If you want a very nice but spendy Italian mean while in London, I highly recommend it. Next time we are in England, we will be going back for sure.",5
"Have not found a better restaurantDear Joshua,

Many thanks for being so detailed while describing your visit in TOZI.

We are grateful to hear that it was a success! Thank you for mentioning two of our best sellers: tagliolini with asparagus and truffle and the delicious pistachio tiramisu. I will pass the feedback about the pasta to the chef, he will be thrilled to know you loved it. We are glad the service was attentive during your dinner.

Hopefully we will have the chance to see you soon again in TOZI maybe druing your next trip to England.

Grazie Mille ",5
"Excellent Experience!I’m very picky with my food especially when it comes to Italian food , this place offers authentic Italian cousin with a modern touch , the food was excellent even the pizza there was very so good , definitely I’ll come back next time I’m in London.",5
"Anniversary tripWe were staying at the hotel where Tozi is located. We decided to have dinner there on our last night. I'm so glad we did. The food and service were excellent. We had the large rib of beef to share. I highly recommended it. We also shared asparagus fritti, spinach, and calamari. For dessert we had a wonderful pistachio tiramisu and ice cream.
I will recommend Tozi to my friends and family when they visit London. If we get a chance to vacation in London again we will make sure to return to Tozi.",5
"What an experience.I took my Mum here for a meal before we went to the theatre. We were welcomed by extremely friendly staff which carried on through the duration of our meal. We were made to feel welcome throughout. It was nice to be able to see the kitchen as the chefs worked away. I wish I could say what my favourite dish was, however every dish we had was presented beautifully and tasted fantastic. The flavours in all the dishes were combined perfectly. My mum enjoyed it as much as I did. This is top food with at a very reasonable price. Money and time well spent eating here. We shall be returning. Thank you!",5
"Interesting, delicious foodDear Ellewell66,

Thank you for the time taken to share your experience with us, we couldn't be happier reading your beautiful words! We are glad you decided to visit us before heading to the theatre and to hear that you have enjoyed all the Cicchetti from you chosen and that the service was also up to standard.

We all look forward to welcome you again soon in TOZI for another remarkable experience.

Grazie Mille!

"DeliciousChose Tozi based on Trip Advisor reviews for dinner on a Sunday evening and it was close to our hotel. Everything about it is good - nice surroundings, excellent, friendly service and really interesting food - Italian tapas-size (but generous) portions, made from really fresh, good quality ingredients. We started with bruschetta and pizzetta to share, then a lovely avocado and radish salad with wonderful pasta with asparagus and truffle, then veal saltimbocca and lamb chops. Don't know how we found room but we shared the best pannacotta we have ever tasted. We were recommended 3 - 4 dishes each to share and had six between us (not counting dessert!) but 4-5 would have been enough. Really good to find a quality Italian restaurant with portions this size, highly recommended!",5
"Best PastaCiao Scillyfan!

Thank you very much for sharing such nice compliments and positive ratings about the Tozi Experience you had with us.

We're very happy you have enjoyed everything, from the tagliolini with truffle to the pannacotta.

I'll make sure to pass your kind comments to the rest of the Team, that would love greeting you once more at Tozi for another remarkable experience!

A presto, ",5

"DinnerFresh and tasty food. We had three different salads which were surprisingly filling - crab salad was lovely. Finished with the panacotta and had a lovely meal. Staff are all friendly and chatty. While this is not a cheap eat, it is worth it.",5
"Home away from homeHello Karen T, Many thanks for your lovely review! We are absolutely delighted to read your feedback and to find out that you had good experience in Tozi. We look forward to have you once again in TOZI for another great experience. Grazie TOZI Team",5
"Dinner visitOur first trip to London, and this was easily the best food we ate while there. But not only was the food fantastic, the ""Hand cut tagliolini, asparagus & black truffle"" was the BEST PASTA WE'VE EVER HAD.
Listen I might be slightly exaggerating...maybe it's the second-best pasta I've had in my entire lift... but it was sooo good... and to boot, the service was friendly and timely, the restaurant was lovely, and it was a great Italian restaurant in central London. All this together for sure makes it best pasta ever.
And don't get me started on the pistachio tiramisu---that was another fantastic dish!
The only downside is that it was quite a pricey meal when it was all done, but the prices are certainly fair when contrasted to similar restaurants.
If you want a very nice but spendy Italian mean while in London, I highly recommend it. Next time we are in England, we will be going back for sure.",5
"Have not found a better restaurantDear Joshua,

Many thanks for being so detailed while describing your visit in TOZI.

We are grateful to hear that it was a success! Thank you for mentioning two of our best sellers: tagliolini with asparagus and truffle and the delicious pistachio tiramisu. I will pass the feedback about the pasta to the chef, he will be thrilled to know you loved it. We are glad the service was attentive during your dinner.

Hopefully we will have the chance to see you soon again in TOZI maybe druing your next trip to England.

Grazie Mille TOZI Team",5
"Excellent Experience!I’m very picky with my food especially when it comes to Italian food , this place offers authentic Italian cousin with a modern touch , the food was excellent even the pizza there was very so good , definitely I’ll come back next time I’m in London.",5
"TerribleWe where 4 people, it took 60 minutes to Come Even tho he walked near us the entire time, the food Was okay but it had horrible staff",1
Horrible ServiceFrankly they don't give a s*it . So you may eat somewhere else to avoid bad service experience . The food is not that good either .,1
ShockingBurned bread and really salty topping. I don't understand why people like it. Or mine is a failure???,2
"Good piadina, but small fillingI tried the piadina Mr. Prosciutto: good quality, but tons of rocket and very little ham and cheese. Ok, we are in London and not in Emilia Romagna, but if I pay 6£ for a take-away, I would expect to eat something more than flat bread and rocket",3
"Try it if you are in the areaFirst of all I have to emphasis that the place is not an actual shop but a kiosk/booth type of place in an open market, so do not expect proper seating and service and if you intend to visit it make sure the weather is alright.

The menu is limited, mainly consisting of ham items or chicken or vegetarian options. We tried the chicken and the mix grill veggies. They do make their own pesto which is a plus of course.

Coming from a place where flatbread is an everyday breakfast item, I wasn't expecting something really out of this world, after all we are used to this bread. The bread itself is thin and crispy, the filling is decent but not very generous or consistent throughout the 'sandwich'.

So in my opinion if you are intending to explore Camden Market sure have this as your first breakfast item, but do not make it a priority to go across London just for this shop.",3
"AverageI used to always get the ""Mr. Brie"", which is tasty, but has become way too salty and greasy!! I love piadinas, but the queue is way too long....",3
"average food average serviceAverage definitely sums up my experience here, I took my 2 children and partner out for an evening meal, and I found the whole atmosphere a little bit 'tired'. The service was basic, no conversation or effort to make my children welcomed, and the food was not anything special.",3
great pleace!!!the place is nice and the food as well probably just the service can be a little bit better but in the end i will be back!,3
"Great food, feels like you're in ItalyAwesome food, great atmosphere, fantastic staff. Not too keen on the cocktail selection, but overall a great experience. 8/10",3
"Nice - but didn't see what the fuss was aboutSo I've been meaning to try this place for a long time and finally I got the chance to. I went for the brie and pesto sandwich and waited about 20 mins for it to be ready and it wasn't really all that busy. The filling wasn't as good as the bread itself, I was left a bit underwhelmed and although I did finish it, I felt like I would have enjoyed something else at the Lock a bit more. Afterwards I bought my nephew chicken wings from another stall and although they said it would take a little while. He had it ready within 10 mins and it tasted really nice. My nephew lapped them up! Wouldn't try it again really!",3
"We have good pizza in New York.Travelled far to get to this place. There are a lot of food choices in this market. The bread was great, but the filling did not stand out. Now Liman blew away our Turkish food in New York. Score 1-1 London vs NY",3
"Good snack but unhygienicCharming Italians are running this place. Piadina was OK and plentiful for the price and better quality than other stalls in the area. But guys, please, you cannot handle cash and pat the food at the same time. No gloves, no wash, nothing. If this is what happens when customers are looking, what happens during preparation? It happened repeatedly while waiting there. Even without this, the food is ok overall, not wow. SO 4* for the food and 1 * for hygiene. 5* for charms. Overall a generous 3.",3
So-soWas eager to try Mr Piadina's flatbread after reading good reviews. I tried the prosciutto. It was okay but not something I would travel to Camden Lock for.,3
"Cheap and goodReally nice ""piadinas"", tasty, crispy and cheap! Had two ""Mr Pollo"" plus two drinks for only £15. There's about 6/7 different piadinas, which includes vegan and veggie options. Nice and helpful staff as well.",4
"Street food camdenDuring a day in camden town I was starving. So, just went to grab food. It was delicious. They also offer free bites on a plate to customers. The staff is young, smily and very cool.",4
"Tasty snack!The flat bread was deliciously good. Tasted like a mix of pizza and flat bread (combination of Italian and middle-eastern style), but to good effect. Worth a snack/quick bite anytime!",4
"GreatGreat food, tasty and delicous. Excellent quick bite or meal if you take the time to site down ( if there's some place left). Medium waiting time but worth it.",4
Ne pas passer outreAn excellent adress to have à Quick lunch in Canden 4 very Nice guys very sympatic Good products and plates prepare in front on you Plates are very tasty A place to go !,4
"TastyThe food was very good. Nonetheless, it was very loud around and a little bit expensive for what you pay.",4
"Good Cheap Piadina!Simple style, but very tasty piadinas at the Lock Market. People where nice and the price was quite acceptable",4
Mr. Piadina's House serves good fast-food Italian Flatbreads.Mr. Piadina's is located in the Camden Lock Market and easy to spot as it has a good location and the lines are long and confusing. I like that you can see the cooking happening right in front of you which makes for a better experience. There's lots of outdoor seating nearby. And paying 6 pounds per flatbread is excellent! If you're hungry buy two.,4
Top Notch eating!They have free samples if you do not beleive me! Delicious and cheap. Everyrhing is fresh. Strongly recommended.,4
"FreshDespite having to wait longer than I expected (as everything is made fresh), the food was excellent!",4
"Excellent flat bread !Probably one of the best flat breads - piadinas - I even teated, and supper affordable. Fresh, tasty and juicy ingredients. The arugula and cheese one was to die for. The selection of cheeses is equally amazing. There's about seven different piadinas that you can chose from, which includes meat, vegan and veggie options. Super nice staff.",5
"Yummy and great valueCute little walk-up spot in Camden market. All the options can be overwhelming but you won't go wrong with this one. Piadini (sandwiches) are warm which is perfect on a cool London day. They were out of the ingredients to make the piadina I had wanted to so I got a different one and it was delicious but don't recall the name...if they ask if you want mayo on it, get it! Very reasonably priced, some covered seating and TONS of Italians working and patronizing this spot which makes it that much better.",5
"Nice little food gemTiny place, good music and friendly staff. Really thin pizza with delicious filling. Around 7 pounds per pizza. Really worth!",5
Simple and delicious :)We had four kinds and every one of them was great with high quality products. Our favorite one was the one with goat cheese. Would definitely recommend if you're at Camden Market :),5
Delicious Mr GrillReally delicious snack - enough to share between 2 so can sample various other street food items around this area. Various options available but the Mr Grill with grilled aubergines and courgette was a winner,5
Quick bite near Camden MarketThanks a lot we really appreciate your amazing sweet review!!! Hope to see you again!!!,5
Best street food of the zoneHave eaten here a few months back. We were lucky to have been able to enjoy eating here on a sunny day! Great place for a quick bite! Delicious home-made food in a great location! Truly Italian Piadina!,5
"Shopping Trip LunchI couldn't expect such a tasty delicious piadina. Hand made, top quality ingredients and friendly welcoming Italian staff. Try the sweet tiramisu too. Price are balanced, just 6 or 7 pounds and one piadina satisfies as a complete meal. I recommend it, Roberto",5
"Will be back!!I have eaten here three times with the students I teach and each time the experience has been great: excellent food, all cooked to order, home made on the premises from fresh ingredients. Friendly, helpful staff. And a driving, lively beat to add to the fun of the occasion. Sitting at rickety tables in the sunshine with the joy of Camden Market waiting for you to explore, what more could you wish for?",5
The real deal!I was there several times during. Great food and always 5 star service. This place is totally worth visiting!! For sure we will be back again!!,5
"Sorry we cant do thatJust came to Pizza Union to get a round of 8 pizzas for the team and was told that the staff are not able to write the name of the pizza on the box. Instead I was told to take a menu and when I get back to the office open each pizza box and figure it out. Tip Top service guys, ill be sure to come and use you again.",1
Stone hard not stone bakedPizza was very thin which I like so came here. But as the pizza reached the table within minutes it went cold and hard. I was scared I would crack a tooth. Pizza is cheap and I see why. Dough quality cannot be good if pizza becomes rock hard when cold. Disappointed,1
"Worst pizza in LondonHI

Sorry to hear you didn't enjoy the pizza. In all our years nobody has cracked a tooth on a thin pizza crust at our place.
Be interested to know if you mentioned this to anyone while in the restaurant so we can follow up

thanks
Pizza Union",1
"Cardboard with a topping, called pizzaI ear pizza out at least once a week and this is definitely the worst one i ever ate
Dry- tasteless - nothing to do with a decent pizza",1
"No gluten free pizzaHI Andrea

Sorry to hear this -which his isn't like all the other feedback we get -please do let us know what you mentioned to the manager if indeed this was the wort pizza you have ever had so we can follow up

Thank you

Pizza Union",1
"LunchIf you have no idea how a real Italian pizza should taste and have no problem with some kind of cardboard with a topping, go to this place. It's cheap food shaped like a pizza and that's about it. What they serve here does not even come close, the average frozen pizza from your supermarket is most likely much better.",1
"Certainly gone downhill!Very disappointing to come and see that the ""gluten free"" pizzas are baked in the same oven. Yes, most the places are doing that, but Pizza Union bakes the gluten free pizza without any container or cover on the same surface as the normal ones. And there's no options to have a cover underneath or something, but they proposed to clean it a little bit better since it was not a rush hour. So, coeliacs.... This place is not for you",1
"How on earth can you call this a Pizzeria???One of the worst wood fired pizzas I have had the displeasure of tasting , let’s start with the base , I looked over the counter to see how they made there pizzas and to my shock I saw a stack of dried bases that looked like pancakes stacked on top
of each other . definitely not freshly made from dough balls ,the edges don’t rise and the bottom is covered in semolina after cooking .the tomatoe sauce had no taste and the cheese was terrible , I left pretty much two pizzas , to be honest I have had a better frozen pizza from tescos , if you want a authentic wood fired pizza go to sud Italia in spitalfields market .",1
"No actual GF options when they say there are?!Spitalfields has certainly gone downhill! Pizzas are out of shape, not enough toppings and seem carelessly done. We wont be going here anymore! This is how it was the last 3 times we went there for pizza. They don't even cut the pizzas properly and do it in a careless manner. The service and quality ha definitely gone down since last year.

Businesses shamelessly tend to do this once they've become busy. They lower the quality of the product and service knowing that customers are creatures of habit and will keep coming.

I heard that the students who live in the building next door have pizza included in their rent. So they obviously go here (if it is true). And I don't think their accommodation complex cares about the quality of the food either.

I've been telling people in the neighbourhood to avoid Pizza Union. We'll never buy pizza here again.",1
"Do not orderSo....I am still sat in this ‘pizzeria’ still trying to digest the ‘pizza’ that has been presented to me or moreover trying to overcome the shock of what I am looking at and tasting!!!

By far, and I mean by far!!! The worst pizza I have had in the UK to date!!!

PLEASE READ THIS ... if you are unfortunate enough to be considering eating here DO NOT walk a little further to Pizza Express...you will get a better pizza there!

This is not a pizza it is an stale oversized pre-stretched piece of flatbread topped with a thin layer of cheap tomato paste and covered in even cheaper cheese...and I mean covered in cheese!!! This ‘thing’ in front of me is tasteless, crunchy, over cooked and has the consistency of rubber...prepare to chew!!!

Bottom line...you work hard for your money and to have a decent meal why waste it here when there is so much better and tastier choice around...just don’t bother even walking here it is as disappointing as I am describing it.

Waiters don’t even ask if you enjoyed your meal...BECAUSE THEY KNOW!!!

I feel so annoyed I wasted money and calories on this meal...over and out!",1
"OK, I guessI mean, pizza is always delicious - even if kind of lame. which this place kind of was. decent prize, especially for London. within walking distance of Shoreditch station, and definitely a hot spot for the college crowd. a bit underwhelming.",2
"PantsThin dough, thin fillings thin on taste, you get what you pay for as the saying goes! Wouldn’t recommend this chain to anyone go to a good independent Italian I will next time. The parts the pizza missing any ingredients basically inedible that’s why I left most of it, poor, poor poor.",2
"LunchThis place had a very high score on trip advisor I’m not trying to say otherwise but I always try to be unbiased as I possibly can , having said that , if your looking for a OK pizza that’s fine, but if you know your pizza that’s not the place to go to",2
"Good pizza, bad flourvHI

Pizza is such a subjective thing, we appreciate that our thin crust, Roman-style is not for you, however you only have to see the reviews from people who do know pizza to know that some simply prefer our stye to others -and we welcome each to their own

Appreciate you trying us out

Pizza Union",2
No toppingsThey do taste good but they use the cheapest refine flour already precooked dough. Not good enough to me,2
Disappointing and overcookedPity the guys on today gave us a Fiorentina pizza with hardly any mozzarella and no parmesan and olives at all. Poor quality today I'm afraid!,2
Cheap and Fast. Nothing special.I’m not sure if it’s because we came on a super busy Friday night but our two pizzas were mediocre and bland. The worst was that one pizza was overdone and almost impossible to cut. Both were bland. The only saving grace was the dolche dessert which I would give 4/5 - that was delicious,2
"Cool place. Not so cool on the pizzaBased my decision to eat here on the fact their chain was the 3 top rated pizza places in London on trip advisor, so I had high expectations, I was, to be honest, a little disappointed.
I can see why they were ranked highly as it was cheap for the location and fast service, but the pizza itself wasn't great!
The minimalist decor was cool, but the pizza base was so thin which was fine but they had been so sparing on the tomatoe sauce that it had patches that were fully BURNT!!! Not crispy, burnt! We shared 4 pizzas between friends and some were better than others but nothing to rave about, I've had better pizza in multiple places in London.",2
"Incompetent staff, mediocre pizzaRush rush rush. Rush you in , rush you out. Fair enough when the food is so cheap in for the area.but really.. I've never had such bad pizza. Ugly shape. Thin, dry burnt base. And the topins weren't tasty. The complimentary spicy oil is good. Music and general atmosphere is on form. Just a shame pizza is so bad! Pizza union.
The answer is in the name!",2
"Got myself food poisoning twiceMe and a friend went to get pizza here. I wanted a vegetarian pizza and my friend wanted a meat pizza - except I wanted the olives from his pizza (which mine did not have) and he wanted the cheese from my pizza (and I didn't want it as I'm vegan). However they refused to switch the toppings between the pizzas and said they could only eliminate toppings from pizzas or charge for extra toppings. So my friend, who doesn't like olives, asked for the olives to not be on the pizza, and if possible have them in a bowl on the side if they couldn't go on the pizza. The checkout guy insisted he knew what was meant, however, the pizza came with olives on it. The woman serving seemed vaguely apologetic but really couldn't care to do anything about it. Also, the tap water was served in tiny glasses and was a hassle to get - you had to ask one of the staff, who were overworked (or busy dancing) to fill up the glass. Seats were uncomfortable. I did not mind the shared table space. The oil on tables was nice, I had some of the chilli oil. The pizza itself was ok but nothing special. If you are on a budget and don't mind the moron staff or difficulty accessing tap water then it might be worth considering.",2
Very cheap!Place is so cheap that all the rest does not count! Be prepared to queue and no service. It is do it yourself job. Pizza is ok nothing soecial,3
AverageThanks for sharing your feedback - not sure what all the rest doesn't count is referring to but at least the queues move fast and the no service helps keep our prices at such great value. Pizza Union,3
Nice but overratedAverage place. Pizza has been burnt on more than one occasion. Drinks are nice. There are many other pizza places I recommend,3
Distinctly averageHI thanks for sharing your feedback -did you ask manager to replace any pizza you weren't happy with? Thanks Pizza Union,3
"Good but not excellentOk so it's cheap and the pizzas are nice. However, the queues are enormous, it's really loud and dark and when visiting on a Friday night recently - it was full of drunk people, there were smashed glasses on the floor and one large group of people were having a food fight!? It was not a nice atmosphere and it too was chaotic for my liking. Like I said, the pizzas are tasty and prices are great for the City, but #2 restaurant in the whole of London? I think not...",3
"Average PizzaThanks for the feedback Emma - it was an unfortunate one-off that someone broke a glass but it was cleared up as soon as we knew and things all got back to normal and everyone continued to enjoy the night. Appreciate in those few moments it was chaotic

Pizza Union",3
"Customer service could be betterAs described, the pizza was just really average. No table service, if you're into a super thin base with a crispy crust, this is the place for you. When it comes to pizza, for me it's always soft sourdough.",3
"Nice but please don't call it ""PIZZA""HIya Thanks for trying us, even though you prefer the thicker dough, over the classic Roman think crust which we make Pizza Union",3
"Good for its priceGood staff the food was ok , but not all that excelled that I was expected, I will comeback? Maybe in some spare time",3
Not as good as expected.Pizza was good but I am pretty there would be much better places if you hunt for. It’s a decent visit but not a must visit,3
"Probably the closest concept of real Italian pizza in LondonI love Pizza Union, I truly do.
Compared to most pizzerias in London, their pizza is a gem!
I love the fact that the crust is very thin and dough well cooked. The staff at Pizza Union are always nice, the pizza makers are really hardworking!
This place can get very crowded, especially over the weekend, but it's worth the wait.
I find the prices very reasonable for London standards and like the area in general.
Only downside sometimes.. the ''clubby'' music, a bit too loud!",4
"Good pizzaIt was not planned, just ended at this place. The pizza is good, the whole thing relaxed and laid back. We got a bottle of wine which was good. I recommend that place for a quick lunch or dinner.",4
"Cheap and good pizzaLove the fresh pizza from the real ovens on site! I have tried most of the flavours and like them all!

I do find the pizza on the dry side but it's crispy as some may say!

I like the sweet ones even more! :) the Coconut, peanuts one is divine!",4
"PizzaVery nice pizza, good sevice and very friendly also very clean. Went there with my daughter and her friend quite enjoyed it",4
"Fun, casual, easyA great place tucked away behind Liverpool Street. A lively yet relaxed atmosphere, fab pizzas, and outside seating. A fun place for a casual catch up with friends.",4
"Good quick mealGood (but not great) pizza, good for getting quick, tasty meal near the centre for a good price. Great value for money.",4
"Tasty, speedy and excellent valueThe pizza really can't be faulted. Light, crispy base, fresh tasting toppings which weren't skimped on, prepared, cooked and served up before your very eyes. Decor and service style was a bit ""hipsterish"" (which would be a plus point for many customers) for me. The chap finishing my pizza off had to explain the concept of the buzzing token to me! The place was coping well with a steady stream of eat in and takeaway orders. Two pizzas, one soft drink and a glass of wine came to the princely sum of £15.00!",4
"Nice foodvery good food quality, very nice stuff with a very cheap price. I love the place, I highly recommended.",4
"GoodHI Great to see that you love the place, we appreciate you sharing your review and hope to welcome you back again sometime soon Pizza Union",4
A place for a pizzaGood atmosphere good staff nice pizza and good base came for dinner and was pleasantly surprised recommend asking server for their favourite,4
"Worst pizza everHow can you make bad pizza in 2018?
Oily, bland, soggy- disgusting. The dough was like pita bread soaking in oil. The egg was hard and over cooked everything was wrong I want to throw up.",1
"No customer loyaltyHello Roger,

Thank you for your review, we certainly respect all views and opinions regardless of it being a good or a bad one, and we absolutely take yours on board.

Please also have a read of our more better reviews in hope that you will be able to understand that we’re only human and sometimes we may make mistakes.

Kindest regards",1
"Awful serviceThe management at this place doesn't reward regular customers with their choice of empty tables even when the venue is nowhere near full, which is often the case.
Therefore for those local diners who appreciate being treated like friends and not just punters this is definitely not the place to go.",1
"terribleHi there,

Thank you for your honesty, we strive to always improve ourselves so certainly value the feedback of our customers, be it good or bad and try to take action in accordance.

As waiters and waitresses, we like to think ourselves as hosts and not just someone who takes your order and brings it to you. As a host, the first thing we try to ensure when a customers walks into our restaurant is personally directing them to a specific table depending on the size of the party.

As well as being a host. we also have to try and calculate who else may potentially walk in and how we can accommodate everyone. We are a rather small restaurant so even if we may not be busy at your time of visit, we have to take into consideration the thought: 'what if 10 people suddenly walk in?'.

As a result of this, we try to avoid giving our larger tables which are either for 4 or 6, to people who are either on their own or with one other person next to them. This is not a strict rule that we absolutely abide by but it is something that we try to do where possible in order to make the restaurant run more smoothly.

Please do accept our deepest apology if we have at any point made you feel like you are not important to us a customer as this is certainly not the case, and I hope this explanation has allowed you to have a look from our perspective too.

We very much look forward to seeing you sometime soon.

Kindest regards,

The Bite",1
"Worst meal in LondonI have been here before and never had any problems, but the staff were very rude to me and my friend today. The restaurant was very busy so we had to wait about 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. Once the waitress did, she simply told us to leave as there were no tables. A few people were leaving so I think she did it on purpose. You should hire friendlier people.",1
"What?!Hi Kerr,

Firstly, please accept my deepest apology for the way that you felt during your visit. I do deeply regret giving off such a negative impression upon yourselves. I can assure you that it was not in the slightest bit intentional.

I would just like to rectify that it was an extremely busy night with many reservations and we were short staffed so it was rather stressful for myself. Unfortunately during times like this we do, unwillingly, have to ask customers to come back, simply because we are such a small restaurant with almost no extra room in which we could have accommodated you whilst waiting.

I do vividly remember that a table had left while you were here, however it was reserved which maybe I should have made clearer to you.

Once again, I am sorry that you experienced this and I do hope to see all again, no doubt that we will make it up to you.

Kindest regards,

The Bite",1
Avoid! Better pizza places nearbyone of the worst attempts at a pizza i have ever seen - it was like someone soaked it in water for 30 minutes. the crust was entirely damp and inedible - i called to complain & was told that was how it was meant to be lol,1
"used to be great , new management, now very poorOrdered for delivery and the food came in less than 20 minutes. Pizza was raw and greasy and inedible. Pasta was overcooked and more like baby food. Save your money and order from somewhere else.",1
"Bad pizzaOrdered a takeaway pizza from here and some things were good - the food was hot when it got here and they’re generous with their toppings. But unfortunately the pizza and garlic bread we ordered were absolutely tasteless and weirdly very watery. A shame but will not be ordering from here again, never had a pizza that was so tasteless before!",2
"Bad pizza. Restaurant is not as advertisedHello Mel,

I am so sorry to hear that you were unable to enjoy our food, we do hope that we can win you back.

Our specialty is that our pizzas are Neapolitan, which in essence is a thin and 'runny' pizza, we also only use fresh vegetables which naturally release their own juice onto the pizza. Understandably, it may not suit everyones taste.

We hope that you can pop in one day and try our pizzas for yourself, fresh out of the kitchen. The time during the delivery process might have compromised the taste which we will look into and try to find a solution.

Kindest regards,

The Bite",2
"Not going backThey claim to serve original italian napolitan pizza, which it's not true.

The pizza quality is less than the average pizzas that I tried in London, the tomato is too watery, and the ingredients used, which they says are super fresh and good, are tasteless.

The place is quite warm and nice, but the food could be better.",2
"Soggy watery pizzaThe place was full and the service was ok although they brought the starters after the mains. The bruschetta was disappointing, looked like cheese on toast. I ordered tagliatelle. The shrimp and courgettes were undercooked with cream on top and taste less. My friends ordered lasagna and baked pasta and was a little better. At least it wasn't expensive.",2
"Overpriced average foodI went to this 'Italian' restaurant with a friend for lunch on a weekday, and deeply regretted it.

The pizza I ordered, although cheap, was watery and the base was totally ruined. The toppings with the cheese slided off the crust every time I was putting it in my mouth.

I have to say it was one of the worst pizzas I've had in London. The price was not too bad given it is located in London, which from what I recall was not too expensive. However, I definitely would not return for the standard of food I had.",2
"Terrible foodWe are very sorry to hear that our pizza was not up to the standard that you expected, however, I would like to give you some information about our pizza.

We serve Neapolitan pizza which originates from Naples, South Italy. The most defining characteristic of this pizza is that it is in fact what some people would call 'soggy'. The reason behind this is that it has a very thin base and has more sauce on it, compared to other styles of pizza. In addition to this, we only use fresh ingredients, including fresh Mozzarella Cheese, fresh meat and fresh vegetables, which is why the ingredients often 'slide' off.

This information is also available on our menu as we try our best to inform customers of the origins of our pizza.

We hope to see you again and will try our best to change your mind.

Kind regards,

The Bite management.",2
"Raw Sauce?The food was just so average. Nothing special at all. It didn't taste good, but it didn't taste bad enough to write a witty and cynical review, either. The service was slow, too.",2
"good pizza,and good atmosphere in this little pizzeriasmall restaurant in Hackney serving a good pizza. The atmosphere is nice and quiet and the staff is kind and professional. Not many guest when I was there so the service was quick.
Prices are ok and they have special offers too.
I did not have any pasta but is looked good (the one of the guy sitting next to me...!)
Would I come back? yes, if around the area",3
"Simple & Good Value Italian CafeWe shared a pasta and pizza, between the two of us, both of which were very tasty. The decor is basic and unassuming. This place is more a cafe/simple bistro rather than a restaurant. There's a comprehensive menu that includes everyone's favourite Italian dishes. Prices are reasonable (albeit some dishes are more expensive in the evening than lunchtime) and portion sizes are generous. Ideally situated with less than a 5 minute walk to/from the Arcola Theatre but not somewhere to spend an entire evening. I would definitely go back, next time I go to the Arcola.",4
"Delicious food!I am glad I looked at the reviews before deciding where to go for dinner. This place had a calm atmosphere, delicious food and great service. Would highly recommend for dinner and lunch.",4
"Delicious ItalianHi Avesta, Thank you for taking the time to drop a review for us, it always makes us happy to hear customers have left with a positive experience. We very much look forward to seeing you again soon. Kindest regards, The Bite Team",4
"Good Italian cookingThis is a bit of a regular spot for me and my boyfriend. The restaurant is really cute and has a lovely atmosphere which makes you feel like you're on holiday.
The food is delicious and the staff are friendly.
We've eaten here on a couple of occasions where I've ordered a pizza that has meat on it, and I've asked for no meat but extra garlic in it's place (I'm vegetarian) and the staff have accommodated this, but I have been charged extra money for the additions even though I've removed the meat (which must be more expensive) my boyfriend has tried arguing this point a few times but to no avail. But all in all a great restaurant which I would recommend.",4
"Excellent foodHello Aimee,

Thank you for your honest review, we very much appreciate it and are happy that both you and your boyfriend enjoy our food.

You are certainly right in the sense that we should not be charging you for a swap of ingredient, we only apply a charge if there is more than one change (it can complicate things in the kitchen).

I have raised this with all staff and we will ensure that it does not happen again, please do accept my apology on this matter.

Look forwards to seeing you again,

"Great meal just a shame no children's portionsWe went here for lunch as we were in the area for the Geffrye Museum. There is a good choice of pasta, pizza, risotto and other Italian dishes at a very reasonable price. The atmosphere was pleasant and welcoming. Would go again and recommend.",4
"Great placeThe food here was excellent, my husband and I came here this evening and the garlic bread/pizzas were very crisp. Unfortunately I didn't realise that the four cheese pizza had blue cheese on it (I'd seen a picture on a review that didn't show any blue cheese so I didn't check) so I didn't particularly enjoy my pizza but that was my fault, my husband's pizza (the italiano) and the garlic bread were absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend, great value for your money and they were more than happy to give us our leftovers in a takeway container.",4
"Yummy pizzas and sidesVisited on Wednesday evening after having a hectic day sightseeing in the city. We sat at the front of the restaurant at a table, that unfortunately, let a cold draft of air onto us every time the door opened - and this was often as it was busy (mostly with takeaway orders). The meals were good and only downside was that there is no child's menu so as our youngest is 9 there was no way he was going to finish the portion of Spaghetti Bolognese. My partner questioned this to see if we could have a child's portion? The lady who served us advised that she could provide a smaller portion but it would be at the same price as the adult; but she could provide a doggy-bag for the residue. Not ideal or wanted as we were staying in a Premier Inn around the corner and just wanted a value for money option.",4
"Best place in Hackney when nothing else but carbs will doBit like a canteen but friendly and helpful staff, great food, ample portions and very reasonable prices. We both had the garlic bread which was very good although light on garlic, for our taste. A long way from home but would certainly revisit if in the area",4
"Cosy, friendly, simpleFriendly staff, easy relaxed dining and a great choice of pizzas and sides. Haven't tried the pasta but it looked good! Easy to walk in when passing by and grab a table. They often have lunch offers but I haven't tried these.",4
Calzone e pizzaVery cozy and comfortable place with friendly staff and nice food. I love the calzone and the pizza. The ingredients taste like very fresh and delicious. Very good option for the price.,5
"Very good priceHello Iggarcia!

Thank you for taking the time to drop a review for us, it is certainly great to hear that we have managed to leave such a positive impression on you.

We definitely value the importance of using fresh ingredients and always buy locally.

Hope to see you again soon.

Spectacular Find!Had two decent sized meals - pizza and spaghetti bolognese - for a total of £11. Tasted great too. Will definitely go back.,5
Great little findIn the area for a family vacation from the US. A great little restaurant that has fresh and very good food. We ordered pizza and pastas and the gang already is trying figure out when we can go back before we return home.,5
"Cute Italian cafe and so cheap!Hello thereeee! Thank you so much for those kind words, it has for sure put a smile on all our faces. Maybe we can open up a branch in the US one day :) Kindest regards, The Bite",5
"The best Italian in LondonGreat long pizza menu with some other dishes . Great food all round, drinks ok, service great. If ever near by again would love to go back",5
"Best Neapolitan Pizza in LondonI’ve been here a few times because I’m a sucker for the £6.50 any pizza or pasta at lunch time - even on weekends. Good food and sizes. The waitress was really nice and attentive and made a great hot chocolate too!

I was sad that it was so empty on a Saturday lunch time because it deserves to be full!",5
"Perfect choice in London! Just go!Me and the girls come here every month and it never fails to impress. The food is incredible, the portion sizes are huge and the staff are so incredibly friendly! Would highly recommend!",5
"DeliciousWe visited this cute little family owned gem of a restaurant for a afterwork meal and found it to be the most tasty pizza ever.

The pizza surely tastes great and the service you get is amazing always with a smile.

As for dessert i’m not a big fan of tiramisu but this place is the only place i eat it with passion (i’m sure there is a secret ingredient in there).

To top the whole experince off i can say you get a tasty meal with amazing service at a very decent price we were surprised at.

If you are after a truly family environment for an italian this is it.",5
"Amazing...Delicious food. Great service!
Great pizza, delicious salad, with attentive kind staff and service. Intimate decor, with music playing. Classy. The tiramisu with nutella topping perfect.
Value for the price, outstanding....great prices for London.",5
"Not for families & rude staffHow can a restaurant staff can tell you that we don’t have to like it when they serve us not fresh avocados sides? Apparently it’s daily made. Well, you can still use rotten avocados when you make it daily.

Anyway, staff was extremely hipster to begin with. They weren’t happy when we showed up with a buggy. There was no kids-oriented meals. When asked out-of-menu suggestions for a kid, they tried to propose us something spicy.

We somehow managed to order, but my son had to pee. Apparently, they made kitchen door next to the toilets. Of course, staff was rushing from the kitchen without looking around and door was smashed to my son’s head. Nobody excused and staff looked unhappy while my son was crying.

Food was OK for its price. Nothing interesting. Side salad wasn’t fresh and tomatoes tasteless. But avocados was really bad. I wouldn’t say rotten but it’s probably at it’s limits.

We were going to pay and leave quickly.

Staff asked why we didn’t eat avocados. That is why we said it’s fresh.

At the same time, I realized that they wanted to charge us %12,5 for gratuity.

I was OK to pay for the avocados but just didn’t want to pay for the gratuity. Because I believed I didn’t got a good service.

Then, someone from kitchen came and literally told us that “it’s daily made and you don’t have to like it”. And she made that comment in Turkish because she somehow thought that will hurt us. That is really hilarious.",1
"Disappointed & NOT dairy freeThe restaurant and menu look great especially for someone like me with special dietary requirements.
BUT!!! when the menu says GF / DF for gluten free and diary free, they are not telling the truth!!
I have definitely been given dairy and am now suffering. I’m on a strict diet and I can tell when I have had it.
I was made to feel like I was stupid for sending back my food because another item I can’t have on my diet was in my meal and am now suffering because I was given dairy. I am really disappointed.
I have to say I noticed the chef using the microwave a lot too nor was he wearing gloves. He was munching away at the food a lot too (not v hygienic). Wouldn’t recommend going here unfortunately. Looks can be deceiving. **Not FODMAP** & **Not dairy free friendly**",1
"Avoid the placeDecent decor, coffee good but it all fails when they add a gratuity fee to your bill. This is unacceptable, it’s not a five star hotel or Michelin star restaurant. Avoid the place, go elsewhere. Note to the owner: don’t treat your customers like fools.",1
DeliverooTotally ripped off via deliveroo. Beetroot carpaccio for 6 pounds was genuinely less than half a beetroot with 4 hazelnuts and specks of cheese. They forgot the beer on the order and refused to deliver it afterwards.,1
"Bad foodI went for breakfast and ordered the eggs florentine. The spinach was watery and had made the rest of the meal soggy, wet and generally unappetising. The whole meal was also really cold. The waitress wasn't attentive and chatted loudly to a friend the entire meal. I won't be going again and I would not recommend for breakfast.",1
"Salads are goodOn one of the occasions I came here for breakfast, I ordered this new beetroot dish they had and I was really disappointed. It's a pity because I do really like this place and come here a lot. But I felt like for this particular dish, they didn't even try to make it in any way appetizing. Hopefully this was just a once off and I don't have another bad experience here",3
"HmmmWent here for a quick breakfast. Orange juice was squeezed as I waited, but was tepid. Cappucino was small and not very hot. They stuck 15% gratuity on the till receipt which was steep and also hard to avoid paying. Nice location and friendly staff.",3
"Nice staff but awful breakfastWent for Sunday brunch. Have had takeaway salads from here before and been impressed but was very disappointed by the food this time. Had a chai latte that just tasted of sugary milk and the veggie breakfas, of which half the plate was baked beans and the potato cakes were sloppy mush! :( The staff are nice and the salads are good but I wouldn't recommend going for breakfast.",3
Food is good but service charge is cheekyGreat fresh food here with nice atmosphere. No pressure to leave when working or having a long lunch... but they add a service charge even if you get a take away coffee. Service should be optional and not added in a way it feels uncomfortable to say no.,3
"Service charges - naughtyThe food was reasonably good, the staff charming and helpful, but the practice of adding a service charge to the bill and then producing a credit card machine that suggests adding a further gratuity smacks of sharp practice.I thought this had been outlawed, and if it hasn't been it should be. If I go again, I'll ask them to deduct the service charge and give a tip in cash. The staff deserve it.",3
Small portionsThe food tasted great but the portions were very small and bread-dominated. No good value for money - unless the meat is organic? Then I would see why it is so expensive.,3
Good but not for picky eatersWe visited this Resturant last night it was a late arrival last minute selection and we where pleasantly surprised. The service was great very quick and friendly and the food was lovely. Unfortunately not an ideal choice for my youngest who is a little picky about her food. That said she did eat the chicken thighs with potato wedges. It was however a little expensive hence the 3.,3
"Family relaxedNice and relaxed with family, kids even enjoyed . Nice place in Dalston whilst we stayed at a hotel near by. Very charming staff",3
"Decent enoughHaving just arrived in the area after a long train ride we were a little peckish. Spotted this place set in a modern office type development. Pleasantly surprised to find a nice deli style restaurant with open kitchen. Great food on show and a buzz about the place. Great looking breads, salads and meats on offer - we ate ciabatta style sandwiches which were fresh and tasty. Good value too.",3

Cafe Route",3
"Very good but questionable pricingThis place is good and does some lovely food, and staff are good and friendly.

While prices aren’t bad, there’s been a recent discrepancy between prices on boards on the one hand and on the menus, which have apparently been updated. The manager didn’t really see a problem with this but gave in after heavy challenge. Sort it out!

Added to that is alas the onward march of the vexatious service charge. I don’t think it’s set out on the bill, but is 12.5 or 15 %, which is frankly cheeky. We were too weakened by the manager’s difficulty in understanding pricing to move on to this one.

A pity that such petty but lucrative approaches undermines what can otherwise be an impressive experience.",4
"Solid breakfast and lunch spotLiving next door to cafe route I drop in for lunch and breakfast all the time. Their salad buffet, toasted sandwiches and cakes are delicious! I love that you can mix and match everything. They offer a great selection of breakfast dishes and you can also order any “off the menu” combination of breakfast items you like. The only dish i don’t like is the tahini and pistachio pancakes which are super sweet, but that’s a matter of personal taste. This is a great neighbourhood staple.",4
Good for breakfastMy second visit to Cafe Route didn't disappoint me. It's not cheap but you get food of very good quality. If you like variations of traditional breakfasts you should give it a try.,4
"Nice little cafeWe went here for brunch on a Sunday with a few friend. The place was bustling and we had to wait a bit to get a seat. The food itself was good and the staff was friendly and we also enjoyed the coffee at the end. All in all certainly something I can recommend, thought not 100% sure what the hype on TripAdvisor is about.",4
"Tasty, filling lunch.I visited this establishment on 17/02/18 with a friend. We glanced the menu from outside but saw it was quite busy no space, as we walked off we saw the fresh salad arrangements through the window & said Oooh! We walked down to the next place hoping for a nice menu & space but it was Tapas, which neither of us wanted. As we turned back we saw some people had left & raced back.
On entering there are bench style tables to your left, regular tables in front & gorgeous looking salads & cakes to your right.
We were instantly greeted & welcomed by a young gentleman behind the till area, who told us someone would seat us. We waited a little while & were taken to our seats at the back by the kitchen. It was nice because it was away from the doors (it was a fresh day), but also you could see into the open plan kitchen.
We were seated at a table with another couple & a jug of water with glasses placed down for us. We were handed menus & told we still had half an hour if we wanted to order breakfast.
They had a deal whereby you could order a main & 2 choices of salad for £12. As mains are around £8.50 & salads £4, it seemed like a good deal.
We both chose the chicken meatballs with a tomato & lentil sauce, which also came with flatbread. For my salad choices I chose new potatoes, green beans with gherkin. And a butternut squash, feta, sage, red onion & chickpea.
My friend’s salad choices were carrots, parsnips & chickpeas. And broccoli, spinach & sugar snap peas.
The presentation when it arrived was vibrant & enticing. It was a very filling dish, we finished it but left some of the flatbread. We had both decided upon entering that we would have dessert, but by the end we were too stuffed. I wanted the lemon & blueberry cake it looked lovely, & seemed to be the most popular. Maybe I’ll have it next time, as I would definitely recommend & return.",4
"Great atmosphereI came here with my partner and his cousin and we had a great time. The guys ordered food and they were very impressed. I didn’t eat so unfortunately I can’t comment on the taste. It did however look amazing and fresh. The menu had a great selection and the price was reasonable.

We ordered two bottles of wine, which the staff helped in the selection. It was very nice. We stayed until closing talking and didn’t once feel rushed. The staff were very friendly and helpful and I would go back again.",4
Good value and great veggie choicesPre theatre Dinner. Had the tuna. Very generous and good side dishes. Definitely worth remembering in Dalston. Good negroni as well xxx,4
"Multi purpose cafeTheir capuccino was good! Then we had some wine with our meal. Started off with their house rose. This was fine then my colleague graduated to the red. Also good. We each chose the squid and crab cakes as our main accompanied by 2 salads both portions were enormous, or my colleague opted for the 3 salad deal for £10. Much smaller portions. The quality and mix of the salads was ok, not specially good. The crab cakes were made from the brown meat and quite gooey inside. So they were okay. Their were homemade cakes available but we were full by this stage. I would probably go again but would keep it simple.",4
Great food but...no heating.... Had to keep my coat on throughout the breakfast. Very friendly waiter and good food for breakfast.,4
"Great food, but odd servicedear caroline2

thank you for your feedback and I'm sorry you had to experience that at cafe route. we had a problem with the air conditioner but I can assure you it is now fixed.

hope to see you again in our warm cafe :)

thank you",4
"Place to goEarly Sunday morning breakfast ,as recommended by my partners daughter, who lives around the corner. Great menu choice , good coffee . Friendly ,efficient staff. Excellent playlist , long time no hear the Fatback Band. Thank you See you “ in a bit “. Steve",5
"The best salad in LondonIf there's a better place to buy salad in London, please let me know and I'll be there! Always good service.",5
"My Everyday Joy !I am a regular at cafe Route. I get my morning coffee there every day.
The team is absolutely amazing they all know my order so all I have to do is tap my card. Often when they see me smoking outside by the time I get in to order my coffee is already waiting for me. Ciro, Maru, Oziem you guys are Amazing !!!! Highly recommend not just for coffee - the food is awesome too!",5
"Favourite restaurant in DalstonCan’t really fault this place. Prices are very reasonable, staff are super helpful - they will even knock some money off your bill if you request for something to be made without the advertised meat.
Fantastic lunch menu, fresh and interesting salads; not just a pile of leaves. Breakfast is also fabulous and is my go-to for when I have visitors.
As a regular customer to this place, I can honestly say it’s one of the best (if not THE best) restaurants in Dalston.",5
"What a lovely breakfastI was heading back home and the high street was noisy and busy. I wanted somewhere quiet and relaxing, then I remembered the Cafe Route. I've been before and decided to check out breakfast.
Service and food was great. What an oasis in a busy noisy area. Must remember to go when I'm next in Dalston.",5
"Fantastic placeIncredible place, great atmosphere and very nice staff. I would visit again. I wish you many more satisfied customers and a successful business. Thanks for everything",5
"A Must VisitOne of my favourite places to eat in London for breakfast and lunch.
Menu is super healthy with lots to choose from, the salads are DIVINE and portion sizes are huge.
The juices are excellent and staff are kind.
It can get very busy and some of the seating is communal, so you might end up sharing a table with some strangers which is quite typical of trendy east london cafes/restaurant.
If you are in the area and looking for some good healthy food, this place is a must! Also right by the tube.",5
"Great saladsSpacious and airy place with helpful staff. Good variety of fresh salads, all very tasty and filling. Good portions too.",5
"Amazing saladI tried their salad one year ago, salad is very filling and they serve quality food. Was very happy to found this place.",5
Informal lunch with clientsExcellent food and service. Perfect for an informal business lunch. We weren’t rushed through and were allowed to chat before during and after lunch.,5
"Terrible experienceI went to this restaurant with my friend after I won a prize at my school’s cross country. The staff didn’t trust me when I showed the voucher, and bothered me whilst eating to say that the meal for two I won was, as they believed, one meal to share between my friend and I. In fact they didn’t even know they sponsored the event I won. They didn’t give us our dessert and wanted us to pay the second meal.

Really bad experience.",1
"No options for vegansWith so many options in Dalston, I must say this is not my first choice but because my boyfriend's parents love it, we have to go there. Don't you think you should rethink your menu? I could only add uncooked spinach, tomato and walnuts to my crepe - it was so dry and terrible! And what is more upsetting, I went there twice and the first time they told me that their mushrooms were alright for vegans so I had them, second time they said they were cooked with butter!

Come on, you are in Dalston! And it's not so hard to come up with a tasty vegan option.",2
"Merd ?Hi BellaHortensia,
Thank you for your visit and your feedback. We are very pleased to hear that your boyfriend's parents love our creperie and feel sorry you don't share that feeling :-(
But you are right, we could do better on the vegan side. Your comment has been taken on board and we will make sure to propose better vegan options in the future. In the meantime, you can try our salads. See you again soon!",2
"After effectI don't normally write reviews. New to this gluten free diet so thought I'd try this restaurant. One child wasn't amused, other loved it, mine tasted slightly burnt. Restaurant smelt burnt. Maryline had great customer service. The let down was all 3 of us having a really bad stomach after",3
Very nice food and refreshing drinks.Went there for early lunch on Saturday. Staff was friendly. Relaxing atmosphere. We had savour crepes and classic sweet one for dessert and lemon sorbet. Had a glass of wine and French cider. Enjoyed all of it. Definitely going back.,5
Amazing family time !Hi Viktorija! Thank you very much for your visit and your kind words. We look forward to weeing you again soon ;-),5
Amazing and great staffWe had a very happy time in this beautiful place. Crepes and galettes were delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant for friends or family.,5
The best creperie in LondonWe used our TimeOut voucher for a great meal at La Petite Bretagne. We had our first experience with savoury crêpes and the Oceane one was really delicious. The sweet crêpes were also amazing. The staff there are so friendly and Marilyn was very helpful with everything and made our visit even better. Really recommend this place to anyone who loves crêpes and some French music in the background.,5
"Fantastic experienceAs a French person, a know a thing or two about crepes, and I must say this place exceeded my expectations
We were greeted by a very friendly waiter, the service was quick and most important the home made crepes were so tasty. I had a savory and a sweet one, I was so full up I could barely walked when I left the restaurant.

The ingredients are fresh, the choice caters to most people and the restaurant itself was pleasant with nice French music playing in the background.

I will definitely come back again and not only once!",5
"Fantastic food, one of our favsHi Rica,

Thank you for your visit and your feedback. We hope to see you again soon! A bientôt ;-)",5
Excellent!this was the first time me and my 3 friends visited La Petite Bretagne as we had bought a deal. We weren't too sure what to expect as past experience of using places like Groupon do not always live up to expectations but we were pleasantly surprised. We could find no fault with the food/service/atmosphere/cleanliness etc. It is clear that the staff are well trained and do their best to make you feel relaxed and satisfied and you are not rushed out of the restaurant. Definitely will be back even without purchasing a deal as it is good value for what you get.,5
"Authentic & tasty crepesI work in London and we mostly use this restaurant for takeaway, but we use it OFTEN. :) The crepes (savoury and sweet) and the salads are just amazing, and the service is terrific. They are very happy to do substitutions to accommodate food needs/preferences.

Our favs are the Veggie Crepe (Emmental cheese, spinach, mushroom); the Tartiflette (Reblochon cheese, potato, bacon strips, crème fraiche, onion); and the simply perfect Classic (butter, sugar, lemon -- one has the option to add ice cream/whipped cream/marshmallow to the sweet crepes, but we've never felt this crepe needs anything more!)

The Supersalad is my lunch standby (includes feta, beetroot, figs and pistachios on fresh green leaves). Just excellent. Also the fresh squeezed juices are superb (the orange, strawberry, mint is delicious).

I don't know how to say ""C'est fantastique"" in Breton, but the sentiment is there. :) Thank you!",5
"Repeat visits to this gluten-free friendly creperie and current Timeout offer.....The crepes and the galettes are so delicious and Antoine, the manager, is always ready to organize an event!",5
"Amazing crepes!Would definitely recommend this restaurant! The crepes are delicious and taste like they are straight out of Bretagne, service is attentive and decor nice. The Breton Treat crepe for dessert was particularly good (roasted apple, cinnamon, caramel and vanilla ice cream)",5
Excellent.I really like this place! Clean and the staff is very friendly. Nutella and banana crepe is so delicious. I will definitely recommend this place.,4
Great for breakfast or brunchCrepes are naturally good and a large selection of savoury and sweet. They also do a full English with a French twist. Which is a large dish and leaves you feeling full. Sever was quick and attentive.,4
"Incredibly Bland and Disappointing DinnerWe popped in to this restaurant for an early dinner earlier this week, swayed by its excellent Tripadvisor reviews.
The restaurant was empty and we settled in to a table by the window.
We ordered meatballs, omelette and fried mushrooms, along with some pittas, with an orange juice and a beer.
We were expecting some really tasty and authentic food - we're fans of Spanish cuisine, we were hungry after a long day out in London, on a tight time schedule, and the excellent TA reviews led us to believe we were in for a mouth-watering treat.
We were so wrong.
Within three minutes of placing our order, the food arrived at out table. I knew immediately that everything must have been pre-prepared for it to have been delivered so quickly.
The modest-sized slice of omelette was palatable, but it sat on a bed of soggy lettuce with a dollop of non-descript pink mayonnaise-style sauce. Ho Hum.
The chewy mushrooms were lukewarm, lacking in any real flavour, and coated in a layer of cold olive oil and paprika. Hmmm.
The meatballs were terrible. The tomato sauce itself was hot was fiery, but the first meatball we cut in to was cold in the middle.
We sent them back and asked for a replacement dish. he waiter/owner looked surprised but no apology was forthcoming.
Within two minutes 'new' meatballs were back on our table. Two minutes... the microwave mechanic in the kitchen must have chosen the nuclear re-heat option.
These were at least hot on the inside, but they were utterly tasteless - they seemed to have been made from some sort of pale and spongy mixture that was more like glutinous pink catering sausage than the flavoursome spiced beef and pork meat we were anticipating.
Put it this way, a Swedish meatball wrap from Pret is a culinary masterpiece that's bursting with flavour, compared to this bowl of bland and truly unappealing tapas.
We paid the bill - £30.60 - and left quickly, feeling horribly cheated and disappointed.
There was no apology from the monosyllabic staff, no reduction in the bill as a gesture of goodwill, and nothing that didn't stop me feeling that for the money this was one of the worth meals I've had in years.
So, my advice is spend your money elsewhere, and don't be even slightly tempted by this restaurant's glowing TA reports. You'll be sorely disappointed.",1
"Time for change has comeDropped in for a coffee. It was ok. Went to pay and it was then things began to unravel.
The charge was £3. I offered a £20 note (did not have sufficient small change or a smaller note).
The woman serving said they had no change. I offered to pay by debit card. She said £3 was below what they’d accept for a card payment.
I said I’d have another coffee. I had a third. Offered card to the machine. Up pops a charge for £10. I query, naturally, being as certain as I could be what 3x3 equals.
It was then that she announced that any card transaction incurs a £1 charge. This was news to me.
It’s at this point the owner (the woman’s husband?) enters the scene.
He insists it is within their right to levy the charge. I suggest it should be within his competence to have a float.
Some choice words in Spanish are exchanged. A £1 coin is slammed down on the counter in front of me.
I pocket it and leave, with more choice Spanish words left floating the air.
As an aside, while drinking all that coffee I was able to study their menu. It was far from impressive.
Put it simply, the glowing reviews on here, mostly in imperfect English, are scarcely credible.",1
Worst mealThe today's special was just bad. Consisted of canned mushrooms and peas. It might be that someone would like something here but only the beer was ok...,1
"Bad all aroundWish that I would have read the reviews on this place before going to breakfast there. The couple who run it are rude and hostile. I walked in and the said one please. The lady said ""What do you want?"" I responded that I wasn't sure yet and asked to sit outside and was eventually brought a breakfast menu. The food was mediocre at best. One slice of dry white toast and was advised that they do not have butter. When I was done with the food, I was finishing up my coffee and took a bite from a cookie in my bag. The man came up and said - ""You cannot eat that here"". I responded, sorry - not a problem. He replied that ""Yes, it is a problem. This is not a picnic place"". He was getting aggressive so I decided to leave the coffee and go. I mentioned giving him a review and he called me an a profane name (term removed per request from the monitors). The Art of Tapas needs to learn the art of customer service. Yes, I made a mistake - but it's not a good idea to react that way. What is more important - to be ""right"" or risk coming across as rude and hostile?",1
"Avoid at all costsAwful customer service and manger incredibly rude. A man on crutches had his drink taken away from him and was told to leave because his wife wanted to sit with him whilst he drank, and hadn't decided to order yet. Disgusting treatment of customers.

Avoid at all costs.",1
"Abysmal - don't botherVery rude and aggressive manager and poor quality service. Food, when they have it, is average at best. My bread with olive oil was stale and hard. I ate a bit, realised it was all stale and asked the waitress to take it back. Manager storms out, and says very unpleasantly that it can't possibly be stale and, anyway, I had already eaten two pieces of it. Paella bland and cheese average. Bottled water excellent.",1
"Avoid this place. Walk on by.What a shame, this place could be so good but we left feeling properly cheated. The limited menu has no exciting tapas dishes, just all the cheaper options at inflated prices. Over £8 for a small plate of peppers stuffed with tasteless gunk, or over priced microwaved meatballs with canned chopped tomatoes mixed in. To make things even worse the ice cream was served from a display which had obviously not been cleaned or refreshed for a while so was mixed with the stale crusts of old product from the edges. I have to admit that I didn't complain as I didn't want to spoil my daughter's special treat of a day in London, but when I got the bill of over £50 while leaving the place still hungry we thought we should warn others. I actually think most of the positive reviews on here must be from owners friends as it can't be this bad and get any positive comments surely?",1
"Nothing specialI visited with family at lunchtime. We had paella which was just left out on the side in a large cooking pan. Had we known it was just left there uncovered we couldn't of had it. We sat outside under scaffolding, we had coffee and soft drinks too. Was amazed to find that a can of Pepsi was £2.50, we were told it was that price as we had the pleasure of sitting on the terrace!! A seat under scaffolding in a fairly busy street with plenty of traffic is hardly a terrace. The staff were rude, particularly the man (who I assume was the owner) he was one of the most miserable people I have ever met. Needless to say we would never return despite my family being local residents. I believe they have a stall selling fast food in the market outside.",1
"Evening meal whilst visiting on businessVisited whilst staying locally for business.

Extremely limited menu to start with but to my regret I decided to persevere.

I am shocked at how terrible the food was. I ordered:
Onlette - cold and inconsistent in temperature; clearly not fresh
Chorizo - not much to go wrong there
Spanish mushrooms - simply doused in oil and paprika
Paella - ready in under 5 minutes, no chicken as advertised
Manchego salad - strips of Manchego served on a pile of McDonald's style lettuce for £7!?
Albondigas - microwaved meatballs in simple tomato sauce - not hot

I had returned the omelette due to it being cold however the remainder of the food I could not return as both members of staff spent my whole meal sitting outside smoking.

When presented with the bill I was still being charged for the omelette and a heated exchange went on whilst I explained that I was not prepared to pay for something I hadn't eaten. I also suggested that I was not happy to pay for a selection of other items however was promptly shouted at.

I certainly will not be returning - awful food and rude and aggressive service.",1
"AVOIDExceptionally rude. Complained as we were charged for food that was dropped on the floor. When complained owner shouted at us. Refused to respond our questions which were enquiring about the bill. Said you may speak to me but I have no reason to respond. We remained very very polite and the staff were very, Very rude. Spent over £100 for three people and exceptionally rude staff. AVOID. He encouraged very drunk and ignorant customers to discuss with me and shout at me Genuinely avoid at all costs. £32pp for the worst experience in London after four head working in this area, including verbal harassment from
Customers and staff!!!! Far nicer places on every corner of Pimlico.",1
"Distinctly averageStopped by here because it was close by and rated so highly on trip advisor. I must say never have I been so let down. The food was distinctly average both in taste and presentation and distinctly above average in price.
Not what I would expect from a ‘top 30’ restaurant in London. This experience has seriously made me question the legitimacy of reviews and ratings on here. I shall not be revisiting, even if I was in the area, and will be advising others against it as well.",2
"You must be kiddingRead all reviews before going...based on the reviews, bad service but good food. We decided to go because it was close by... I can see why people complain about the owners, as they were dry but tolerable.
BUT, the food was almost inedible! First, the paella which normally takes 30 to 40 minutes to make took less than 3 minutes to the table. Most likely a microwavable! And had no taste. We also ordered their garbanzos. They were cold, hard and tasteless as if poured right out of the can and not heated. The cheese croquetas and meatballs were bland. On the postive, their wine and cheese selection was good. One hundred and thirty five dollars later, we ordered 8 tapas and only the cheese and wine was good. Ultimately, its neither authentic or good.",2
Simply poorWent there for dinner and had poor quality food. The place has no charm and it doesn't seem that they care about it. The service wasn't bad like other reviews say though. Yet they seemed indifferent.,2
No wonder it was emptyThey got our order wrong and then responded angrily when we questioned it; the breakfasts come with toast but when we asked for butter we were told 'no butter'. And 'no oil' either. My friend described their attitude as 'squalid' which seems fair. Picture of dry toast attached.,2
"Microwave Food !!Nice ambience and authentic staff but the food pretty poor, all you could hear was the microwave go ""ping"". However the Sangria was nice and the staff were very pleasant.",2
VisitWhat could have been an enjoyable experience this evening was tainted by rude unwelcoming service. I live close by and won't return. Pity,2
"IbericoThe place looked interesting, so we entered. We were the only customers. Quite pricy (small portions = tapas, pricy compared to that), weird but still kind of friendly staff. Iberico (ham) was excellent, otherwise not so special.",2
"A spoiled visitOur first reaction on coming across this small tapas bar whilst walking back to a friend's flat was ""if this if good, it'll become a regular haunt"". The food was quite tasty (though nothing special about rustic bread), wine and beer fine...but we made the mistake of asking for clean plates when we ordered some and ham (spending over £12 on latter, didn't seem a big ask) and this seemed to be like red rag to a bull, the manager reacted very badly to this and we still don't know why! There seemed to be an accusation that this was just another dish so we should have carried on using the same....even if true in Spain, still a really odd attitude to customer service. Our bill came to over £70 for 3 of us and we all walked out genuinely disappointed that we won't be going back - it could so easily have been a different outcome.",2
"Not worth the moneyGone down hill, looks nice and the food is okay to good (bit salty) but definitely not worth the price. the atmoshpere use to be nice but he place is getting cluttered with second hand stuff and bad art. The owner can also be a bit moody in his service.",2
BreakfastPopped into this place for something different for breakfast. Something typical of Spain - chorizo and omelette. Lovely coffee too.,3
Small but goodThis is a quite new spot in the Pimlico neighborhood. It's small in space but the food is very good. When the weather permits they set up tables outside. By the time of my visit they didn't have liquor license so BYOB is welcome with a small corkage. They offer a very good paella or some simple dishes and tapas with a good selection of Spanish hams. You can also use the take out and enjoy at your place. If you are staying at the Dolphin House this is a very good suggestion for a festive meal at your apartment.,3
"Beautiful paellaSadly I only discovered this restaurant on my last day in London, the seafood paella is amazing and a fabulous beer, the waiter was good",4
"Nice tapasThis place is a really good Spanish restaurant, the tapas were superb and the sangria is great with peaches",4
"Great little placeWe just had lunch today and the food was really nice, and quite impressive the jabugo ham so tasty it is the best Spanish ham, the sangria was good",4
"Tasty tapasStopped for a snack and ended having lunch, they have a superb ham ( jamon ) and the manchego chess is mature and rich flavor, good tapas and friendly staff",4
"This ham is superWe loved ham and the Spanish is better then the Parma ham, but this ham is one of the best we had and we lived in Malaga",4
"Great luchIf you are looking for cuality this is the place but it is not cheap, the menu of the day only has 3 starters and 3main couse to chouse, but it has to be for the entire table so we had just same mix tapas, i am spanish and the food is good like in spain, their hams are nice but not cheap £7.00 for 100g, the waiter was friendly and eficient and I will came back soon",4
"Nice coffeeI had same nice coffee with a friend in the terrace, the location is perfect in the morning with the sun",4
"Perfect Spanish breakfastThe Spanish omelette is the authentic one, and the fried chorizo so tasty, the coffee is really good, the orange juice is from concentrated but is OK for the price, nice decorations and with Spanish music",4
"VacationStayed in the area and wanted to try the local fare. Wasn't disappointed with this little gem. The paella was on point and the Spanish tortilla was delicious, the only complaint was the bed of lettuce and mayo based dressing it was served with. Also the recommended house Spanish Tempranillo wine pairing was delightful and a good price.",4
"On a busy evening in Pimlico we found a delightful place to drink and eat, a haven of tranquillity .My partner and I, my brother from .australia found a delightful place to share a couple of bottles of wine and eat good food prior to a visit to the Canaries, This place should be better known!",4
"Unforgettable experienceThis tapas bar lived up to every positive thing I had read about it and more, what an amazing ham and the paellas impressive the flavors we were tasting were just so unbelievable, the vodka gazpacho delicious, the boquerones and octopus unbelievable, we will for sure come again!",5
"BuenisimoI live in London for over 3 years and most of the Spanish restaurants are just a littel Spanish with non native chefs, this place is real proper Spanish, we will be back soon with more friends",5
"Impresive jabugo hamI just had a fantastic Spanish paella with a board of jabugo ham and a pint of Galicia beer, really good",5
"Perfect lunch dealWe had a great lanch deal a starter and a main course for £10, the food is fantastic and the Galicia beer is a really good lager",5
"Deliciously goodNice restaurant, the paella with chicken simply delicious the rice cooked perfectly and with a rich taste, and the sobrasada like been on Mallorca, the sangria is great, I will be back soon with my Spanish friends",5
"Nice placeI love Spanish food and this restaurant has the best paella, the sangria is quite good and the staff are nice and friendly",5
"Good foodThe best sangria jug with peaches, the paella, choriso and croquets are really good but the best is the black ham and lomot the are superb, nice place and friendly spanish waiters",5
"It was awesome! Best tapasLast weekend I was with my friends near victoria and we stopped for tapas, it was amazing food and excellent seevice, the tapas are not that small and nice price, we will be back soon",5
"The best ham of my lifeWe'd been to this restaurant a few years ago and had a simply superb experience, been back in london we couldn't resist, if anything it was better than the first time, the food sublime and the service perfect, top place in every dimension",5
"Deliciosas tapasGreat little place with a dozen or so tables and reasonable choice from a menu perspective.

It may look little but the portions and flavours are big - the service is what I would expect if I were on mainland Spain. We enjoyed it here and others have and will continue to do so.

A combination of their ham, paella, stuffed peppers and meatballs were plentiful and left a smile on my face as we left - very satisfied.",5
"Awful Phone Servicei called the restaurant to book my boyfriends birthday dinner, and it when i called i was hurried on the phone to explain my reservation. the person that picked up the phone dint have any manners and wasn't at all friendly. i had a special request as i wanted to celebrate his birthday at your restaurant. I'm glad i didn't as if you can talk to potential customers so poorly than imagine how you treat them at the restaurant. It doesn't take 2 mins of your time to welcome and greet your guests on the phone.",1
"Sorry... Not very good at all .Missing all the real Turkish experience you expectAs i always say ...A review should be judged by what a reviewer really knows rather than thinks . From the start i knew it was not going to be amazing . No real welcome and no smell of food at all . There is no such place as a restaurant with a open plan kitchen and you cannot smell wonderful meats been cooked etc . We eat Turkish food more than most.I have lived and travelled in Turkey . I know very well the basics of good Turkish food. I have had very good ""training"" from real Turkish foodies there . In no order .The bread....! What a joke .No good restaurant in Turkey from Istanbul to Van serves bread like this . The starters are what 99% of people would expect to be placed on the table as part of the basic offerings ""Not charged for"" .The Hummus tiny and bland .I doubt made by the chefs. The Borek was again boring .I ate better this morning at a local corner shop . The calamari was a joke .Chunks the size of potatoes in cardboard flavoured coating . Again I would like to know of fresh . And if not ""pre formed shrimp /junk paste calamari "" so often sold . Then we have the service . Great to see the rubbish bags been taken through a high end restaurant in the middle of service ! And also, I dont need a waitress to 'advise"" me what is good. She will not be eating it or paying for it . Main Course had nice elements .The kofte was nice . But the lamb with mash potato was confusing as i have never seen that in Turkey before . The price is not cheap . The restaurant must trade on it decoration (Nice) rather than the quality of the food. Its as bad as ""Efes"" There as so many places like ""Mangal 1"" in Dalston that is so superior for food compared to ""Kibele "" . I could go on and on. It was rubbish .simple badly cooked and extremely bad value food . And thanks for not even saying good night when a party leaves who have spent hundreds . Kibele is not for people wanting good Turkish food .Its for people who just want to eat there and not bothered about the quality or having no idea .",2
"Okay food, service very poorVisited this restaurant on Saturday for brunch (as part of a deal on Groupon). The restaurant was relatively quiet. Our main problem was the service (or lack of)... our waitress was incredibly polite, but generally useless and slow (she also spilt a drink on me). The food (which was a simple eggs and avacado meal) took over 30 minutes to arrive and the coffees were served without any sugars etc (we continually had to ask for drinks and simple things like seasonings and cutlery). I think the food was nice, but wouldn’t return - you can have some really lovely brunches for the same price elsewhere and the service in other places has been impeccable by comparison .",3
"2.5 StarsWe bought a groupon code for three people to include breakfast and a hot drink. Based on Great Portland Street, the restaurant it’s self is modern and inviting. The restaurant front was open and let in a good breeze on a summery day.

The breakfast came with bread, jam and butter which was a bit above average-nothing to shout about but a nice addition to the meal. I ordered an iced coffee which tasted like a standard iced coffee, my sister ordered a mint tea that lacked the mint! Was not until the meal was finished that the tea have fully brewed.

We all ordered the menemen which was not as expected. It was a wet tomatoey scramble mix, they had also forgotten the Turkish sausage. We asked for this to bought to us on a side plate. The meal it’s self lacked seasoning and was a bit too wet for more liking. Not much to say about the dish, big portions with a lot egg.

The service was good, the staff were friendly and accommodating when I requested a iced coffee over a hot drink (as included on my groupon code). I think staff ( or at least the lady who served us) need to be able to explain items on the menu better. When we asked her about the breakfast meals she didn’t explain it well and we were brought a dish we most likely wouldn’t have ordered.

I think that we probably ordered the wrong mains and would probably go back for dinner or lunch rather than breakfast.",3
"Attentive staff but disappointing foodI was so excited to visit Kibele as the traditional Turkish menu looked super yummy but I was unfortunately left feeling disappointed with our experience. The decor and interior design is lovely, really classy. The staff are lovely, helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. However, the food was average. We ordered the gourmet hommuos to start which was really good (enough to share for two). Strangely though, we were served the complimentary bread and olives about 10 mins before the hommuos - which we ate - and the hommuos came without bread or anything to dip in it ... odd. For main, I had the lamb koftas which came with tomato cous cous, a very small bit of red cabbage, a trough of garlic yogurt and a tiny thin piece of tasteless flatbread. The lamb koftas (all 5 of them!) didn't really have much flavour and were more like 5 burgers and the cous cous tasted like it came from a microwaved packet :( my partner had the lamb shank. The meat was ok but it came without a sauce/gravy so it was quite dry. His Garlic mushroom side was good though if not a bit random with a lamb shank!!! I didn't have dessert (which I normally always have) as didnt want to be disappointed by this too. Wouldnt go back which is a shame as also say the menu read beautifully. Also - as per other reviews - the front door doesn't shut properly so you have to rely on staff to shut it promptly every time someone walks in or out to avoid the annoying draft... oh and we were sat right by it!!",3
"Food was half decent, place is a bit pretentious. Service was great thoughFood was half decent, place is a bit pretentious. Service was great though
Food was a bit above average. In all honesty, I have had better for much less in London. There are some hidden gems nearby which would be a better option. Portions were small too.

Lunch meal deal still ended up costing me £20 and I wasn't full afterwards.

Felt forced into getting a bottle of water (which they charged me £3 for) before I even sat down. When they asked if I wanted some water on the table I assumed it was just tap water. But whatever.

Sense of pretentiousness in the air.

Service was excellent in all honesty, and probably what you are paying for here.

Was a bit miffed that they don't accept AMEX ""because it costs too much"" considering the price to portion ratio. Almost everywhere else in the area accepts it.

I would say that this is a fantastic spot for business lunches, nothing more. Might be good with a date but I can think of better places to be honest. HOWEVER saying that they don't accept AMEX so think about that before you do book in.",3
Shut that doorI see in a review 6th Jan that a customer complained that the door did not close properly This is still the case!!! We constantly had to get the door closed all evening to stop an extremely cold draught. Why hasn’t it been repaired?Then the music started we couldn’t hear ourselves speak. What an unpleasant evening for over a £100,3
"Food left a lot to be desiredWent here on a Wednesday evening at about 8pm and when we first walked in a young man was standing by the reception desk, I said hello and got no reply. I asked for a table for two and smiled and got a blank look. It wasn't the best of starts. A young girl then came rushing up and greeted us and asked if we'd booked and took us to a table.

We were given menus and left to look. I ordered a glass of red wine and my son had a glass of tap water. A jug was brought to our table and I was offered a glass too and had one and it was nice and cold.

We were also bought some olives, hummus and some ciabatta bread slices. These were all lovely and good quality. I wish the rest of our food had been as good.

I ordered manti, which was described as Turkish dumplings with mincemeat and vegetables inside with a tomato sauce served with it. What I got was more like tortellini with a tiny amount of quite hard mince inside with absolutely no flavour at all in the whole dish. The dumplings were quite hard and there was no seasoning or herbs or anything. There wasn't enough sauce to go with the meal and it was pretty awful. I ate about half as I was hungry but just couldn't eat all of it as it was like eating cardboard. For £15.95 this was very overpriced.

My son had kazu sis which was lamb with rice and a side salad. He liked the taste and the rice was really good but he did find about half of his meat quite tough and chewy. He gave me a piece to try and it was very chewy - I couldn't swallow it, so I was quite disappointed that this was quite expensive but also very poor quality £16.95.

The waitress noticed I'd left about half of mine and asked if there was a problem, so I told them and she offered to get something else for me but I didn't want to wait for another meal, so I said I'd have dessert and I didn't want to make a fuss.

I ordered baklava which came with ice cream and the cake part was very nice. This was given to me free of charge.

My son ordered kazandibi which was custard cake and it was and extremely small portion, he wasn't happy with the small size of it. This was £5.95.

The waitresses were very attentive and we were given excellent service, it was such a shame that the food didn't match and the quality of the meat especially, was so poor.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all and we decided not to go again as our meal was so bad even though this place was very close to our hotel.",3
"An OK experienceAtmosphere: Quite a nice atmosphere in the restaurant and well laid out although the server put us at the back of the restaurant next to the kitchen and by a group of 4 men who kept rocking the bench behind us, so it wasn't exactly the relaxing experience it could've been.

Service: One of the waitresses who served us was all over the place. For example, taking our place settings only for us to have to replace them with those from the adjacent seats. We weren't sure if it was her first day on the job but it certainly felt like it. Apart from that it was OK.

Food: I ordered two starters, the Karides and Kuskonmaz. They were fine without being out of this world. I had the Kunefe for dessert which was nice, probably because it's not something I would normally have had.

Verdict: We travelled from Lancaster Gate to Kibele because of the trip advisor reviews but I would say unless you're in the Great Portland area it's not worth the trip. Nice enough but not out of this world. Caveat: I didn't have any of the mains.",3
"Relaxing dinner, with some chillsWe walk in. We are assailed by borek, which is outstanding. This is, in Trumps words, the GREATEST borek of all time. I’d collide with Russia just to get more of this borek. The lentil soup - has the right texture, the right spice, the coriander is truly exquisite. The kabab, it felt as if I was I was on the streets of Izmir. HOWEVER THE DOOR THE DOOR DOOR. The door doesn’t close properly so every two mins they left the door open!!! Rather than eating in blissful turkey I felt I was eating in Northern Sweden (and not in a good wAy) as it was very cold and -2 outside. I think the staff needs to be a lot more considerate about this.",3
"Nice setting, do not order FeastThe setting was very impressive, the music was OK, and the service prompt. However, the vegetarian options tasted quite bland. My partner ordered the Feast which is an absolute rip-off since it seems as if it is £32 to share between two people but it is actually £32 per person written in the small print making it very expensive for a small amount of food. We also received extra drinks which we had not ordered and felt obliged to pay for them since they had replaced an earlier glass of wine that was knocked over. I would only recommend this place if you eat meat.",3
Food was great but the staff were extremely rudeTbh everything about the place was great! The food was really good but the staff definitely lacked manners! And that sort of put me off. Dont think i'll be visiting again,3
"Great service & tasty foodHad a booking for a Friday evening with a friend, turned up late which they were fine about. Restaurant had a nice ambience, with a live guitarist playing music. Good selection of Turkish food available, all arrived in good time. Very attentive waitresses/waiters which was great. Would definately go back again!",4
"Amazing! Really niceFood was lovely and the service was even better! Mimi was really helpful, smiley and such a pleasure. Would definitely return.",4
"Good food and Nice atmosphereA nice Turkish restaurant with good quality food, lovely staff and great service. They also have a fantastic musician playing good old classics whit a twist with is amazing guitar solos. If there is anything to criticize, it is that it’s a bit expensive.",4
"Something newI, personally, am rather unfamiliar with Turkish cuisine. Nonetheless, the meal was very nice. It was interesting to explore new dishes. The atmosphere is very nice: the staff was very courteous and the furnishing was curious but still nice to look at.",4
"great brunch!If you're looking for a nice brunch, that's the right place! Nice warm sesame bread with a selection of jam, honey and tahini, a cheese platter, eggs, delicious borek..everything very tasty and with reasonable prices. Nice atmosphere, very new and well furnished and kind staff. Highly recommended and I will definitely come back!",4
Good Food & ServiceDelicious sea bass (2 fillets!); Waitresses and waiters are really friendly; Enjoyable and relax atmosphere; Close to Holiday Inn Regent’s Park,4
BreakfastThe food was excellent. I sat outside in the sunshine and people watched! Service was slow but in fairness the waiter apologised three times. I have eaten dinner here before and again the food was top notch. It isn't cheap but you do get what you pay for - there is a Nandos opposite if you are on a tight budget!,4
"High end of fast foodI visited the restaurant in a International meeting of more than 100 people. Food is mote than decent but some plates seemed to be out of the can and not cooked in-house. It’s true that the food was not out of the cheapest Sainsbury’s products. Taste is not as in Turkey, wine were of the medium low category. Temperature in the restaurant was not well controlled, it was really cold. I kept my jacket on my shoulders but the women in the meeting were not so happy as outside it was more than 26 C... The Turkish “minstrel” played goldies of my youth (70’s) with real talent (a little bit too loud however). The kitchen could not face the invasion of more than 100 people so some people just received the first plate while others had finished the second one... Food is better than in the majority of ethnic restaurant, but not so far of the Turkish fast-food in Turkey.",4
Turkish delightDinner at Kibele was a Turkish delight... cool restaurant with live music at just the right volume . We were looked after by Madlen who let me change round what was on the menu so I got exactly what I wanted and it was delicious... beautifully cooked meat with that straight of the bar b que flavour....,4
"Really great food!Really great food - good options for a vegetarian as well which is pretty unusual in my experience with Turkish restaurants. Really tasty! Love the fact that there was a complimentary desert.

The staff were lovely but perhaps over attentive at times. We are on a Friday night fairly early so I think there was a fairly heavy staff to customer ratio. Great that the staff were checking in but we were asked how our main was 3 times which was a little much for us (some others may love that though!). Staff did give great recommendations of options though.",4
What a breakfastHad the best breakfast in my life here. Great service and the omelette was delicious. I never been in suck a clean and spotless restaurant like this. The waiter was so good,5
Five star breakfastWent for breakfast. Was greeted warmly by friendly staff. Excellent service. Warm ambience. Amazing food. Will definitely return,5
"An excellent Turkish restaurantSix of us had a meal there last night. It was the first time I'd been since it's previous incarnation as Efes. We all thought it was a lovely room with a great atmosphere. The decor is is very well done but I was disappointed that we didn't get a banquette. I will remember to book one next time! It was nicely busy, with a mixed clientele including children. The food was fabulous - the best Turkish food I've had in London. We all enjoyed it and plates were cleared. Two of our party are vegetarian and that is well catered for in the menu. The service was very good and unhurried. I would just make two suggestions: get the door fixed so it doesn't keep blowing open (the staff was constantly racing to shut it again) and the website is quite difficult to read. It moves around a lot and the a la carte menu is difficult to read. Might need some tweaking. That said, I'm still giving it five stars because it was a great evening for all of us.",5
"Known it for years, and in its previous incarnationHave been twice in the last few months. Once as a business lunch and lastly with the family. Great food, good value and exceptional service...What did i like best?,,,,hmmm all of it!",5
"Excellent foodFabulous restaurant and well worth a visit. Really good service from pleasant staff and a lovely setting for an evening meal. Good to view the chefs working hard in the open kitchen area at the back of the restaurant and producing such excellent food. Tasty, well prepared and well presented fare and all at a reasonable price. We would definitely return to eat here again.",5
"Wonderful flavours top off a great venueWe were staying near Regents Park and on the hunt for evening meals. Having had a very disappointing Italian meal the night before in Charlotte ""Eat"" Street, we were looking to enjoy a good meal. We were struck by the open ambience of Kibele as we walked down from Gt Portland St tube station. Smart decor, open space, comfort. Discrete but available service and some wonderful Turkish flavours. Simple and understated menu but fantastic food. Reasonably priced and a good wine list. Most certainly made up for the previous night. Our host was Deniz.",5
"Good food, good serviceWe went for a lovely meal at Kibele recently. We've been a couple of times before and we've always found the food to be very good. The restaurant hasn't been open too long and it's really nice inside - and clean. The service is great - we were served by Madlen this time and she was brilliant, really friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We will be back again soon!",5
"Best customer service in LondonI recently celebrated my 22nd birthday at Kibele and the service was absolutely incredible! The food, the ambiance, the staff, it was all 10/10. I want to personally thank Deniz and all the staff for putting up with my loud group of friends and for making my birthday a memorable one. I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this restaurant.",5
"Simply amazingThere’s not too many words to describe this place! As I said simply amazing! A real Turkish Restaurant! Very good menu,great wine selections,good service and also I love the decoration.. Definitely recommend to everyone :)",5
"... a great place... visited Kibele twice now for a light lunch, both occasions superb very reasonably priced and great, beautifully presented food & ... super service too from Madlen, Mimi and team!",5
"Lacked common senseAfter reading it's very high reviews I was excited to visit with some friends and their baby. After forking out for quite expensive parking we arrived to find that our pre-booked table was not suitable. I had booked a table for 4 adults and 2 babies, the restaurant had failed to provide us with an adequate seating location and had given the high chairs to a family that had walked in not 5 minutes before we arrived. The excuse was poor, they said sorry it's a very busy day for babies. I felt that considering it was listed as child and baby friendly it should have had ample high chairs or at least been honest about the arrangements when confirming our booking. Please look further afield to avoid disappointment.",1
"Disgusting hygeineHi Bill! I'm very sorry about this situation. It is true I got confused with bookings as the table that arrived just before you had the exact number of people (5 adults and 2 babies) and were not too sure about the name on their reservation, so I ended up giving them our last 2 highchairs (that were reserved for you). That said, we had plenty of room to accommodate your group comfortably, I just need another minute to organise the situation that's why I kindly asked you to wait by the green sofa while your friends had not arrived yet. Highchairs are not a problem as we have a very good relationship with our neighbour pubs, I was about to go there and borrow a couple. You just didn't give me the chance to do so.
I think there was miscommunication due to my English, that's all.
You are welcome to come visit us again!
Pietro",1
"Worst birthday everThe courtyard at the back of the pub is disgusting. Broken glass and food just thrown on the ground. Overflowing rubbish bins, fat in the gutters, an old fridge and food waste in open supermarket carrier bags which must be attracting vermin. One can only imagine what the kitchen must be like. Had we seen all this before we ate there we would most certainly have dined elsewhere.",1
"Disappointingthank you for telling me that our common courtiyard is dirty but my bins are the small blue ones next to my bycicles on the left so the clean ones..i do not know who you are but for you having access to that area you must be one of the people working in this courtyard..so what happened? do you know who did that mess? usually us and health center really care for the area. where you upset and you hang around pushing and throwing waste on the floor?
anyway i do not think that you did the right thing discussing problems between neighbors or maybe with the council or generally bin collectors which have nothing to do with the pub ( which has 5 in hygene rating) in a public site . it seems to me that you are doing this in purpose
trying to put down our business . i felt this move unfair and not professional therefore i asked to trip to consider this a fraud. anyway we love our small little pub and our kitchen is an open kitchen..everybody can see it.... Paola and Pietro",1
"The most unwelcoming pub in LondonAfter reading all the wonderful reviews on Tripsdvisor I’ve decided to book for my husband’s birthday day out as we went to cinema nearby. I understand that this is pub not a restaurant but still I would expect my small request when I’ve done reservation to write “happy Birthday” on my husband’s desert plate to be done, at least some small surprise. Instead of that waitress asked him just when we were seated “is it your birthday ?“ , my husband said yes, she said “happy birthday “... and that was it. I still don’t understand what was the point of that question...it was really intrusive, all I’ve asked is just to make a little note for him on his special day. It was only 3 tables in the pub so they could prepare that desert plate and give us some special attention. Absolutely embarrassing I felt when we left. Ruined day. So don’t be fooled by good reviews, it’s just a pub with ok Italian food, nothing much, believe me I’m Londoner.",1
"Fantastic decor - shame about the food...Went to this place to eat after a friend had recommended it. There were 8 of us, two are vegetarians, so we ordered 8 ""Gourmet tasting menus"", with 2 to be vegetarian. It started off well enough, with acceptable veggie and meat lasagnes, then a veggie calzone. Nice, but hardly ""gourmet"". Everything arrived in rotation, so you ate what you wanted and then it was taken away - you couldn't have any later.
Then came more pasta with cheese, gnocchi with cheese, and 2 meat pastas with cheese, until one of our party pleaded ""no more pasta, please!"". Then some beef arrived. This meant that the last 3 dishes to arrive were not suitable for vegetarians (even though the waitress said that one was, it had minced meat in it), so 2 of us sat with nothing to eat. Mind you, we were stuffed by then anyway..
In summary, 7 dishes; 4 were pasta and cheese, one gnocchi and cheese, one calzone and one beef. Hardly ""gourmet"". I was desperate for a vegetable!
Pudding was really disappointing - 4 profiteroles and 4 cannolis, which we had to cut in half. Mind you, my heart was already protesting at all the stodge and cheese, so I wasn't really inclined for any pastry and cream/mascapone.
£18 for a ""gourmet"" meal that was, essentially, pasta and cheese? I don't think it really represents value for money.",2
"Pleasant but chaotic !Booked a table for two for Saturday at 19.00 . We arrived dead on time ,the place was packed . People who were just drinking were occupying the tables that had bits of paper with reserved written on them . We were asked to wait while the friendly drinkers hogged the tables . We were eventually given a small table by the door and by what turned out to be v near where the musicians were going to set up their equipment .
We ordered two pizzas and two small salads . The pizzas turned out to be pannini style flatbreads with no tomato topping . The sort that cost £1.50 each in Tesco . They tasted acceptable . These two pizzas with topping cost £26 !!!!!
The £4 side salad was a few green leaves and two cherry tomatoes . With drinks the total bill was £ 40 .
Good value ? You decide .
There was no room for the musicians in this quite small space so the customers were pushed up very cosily together .
We left before the music started .",3
"A busy, buzzing place.Four of us ate here, and the atmosphere is great, the staff friendly, and the owner plays his customers very well. Unfortunately the food was all a bit chaotic. We opted for the taster menu which consisted of three or four different dishes, the problem was, two of them arrived at the same time and the third before we had finished our first. So our waitress put it on one side for us, our waitress did seem a bit confused.
To his credit the owner spotted this and had it sent back. We will certainly visit again, and hopefully leave a more favourable review.",3
"Traditional pub re-invigorated for Greenwich trendies, with quirky twistHallo there, sorry for being late to unswear i had to think a lit bit to understand what had happened...yes, you are right sometimes the kitchen is so deep in their role to be fast that they serve too fast and surely the girl who attended you did not see that you were stuff with food on the table.
Sorry for this. We learn everyday and now we are trying to pay more attention on this very important part of the service.

interesting pubHad a family meal here with live music. Go for the Pizza. Very friendly staff -who were helpful. Several things on the menu were sold out to my husbands disappointment.,4
"Not bad at all ...Came here for a date night a month ago and really enjoyed the cosy atmosphere upstairs where our reserved table was waiting. Half way through our meal the live music started which was a great addition. Only downside was the wait we seemed to have for our 2 pasta dishes and our drinks. Also my boyfriend's dish was slightly lacking taste and needed extra parmesan to season! Not a bad experience though, would definitely return!",4
"Looked at reviewsLooked on trip advisor and decided to give it a go.
Very friendly, guess a family affair.
I asked for something off menu and they delivered - was lovely. Wasn’t quite enough food/portion size for a 6’2 husband though. He ordered a pasta meal with bread and peas. Although the said it was tasty, there were no peas? Maybe a bit more pasta?
Great atmosphere and we would go back. Very quirky but does get busy so need to book table.
Enjoyable!!",4
"Eclectic Decor, Warm and Friendly Atmosphere, Good FoodItalian food, the family owned and run pub is a great place to get a good meal. The food was good, the atmosphere was welcoming and the decor was very different. The owner greets everyone as if he’s known them forever. He makes the place!",4
"The prince charming of beersWe had some great beers at this really nice pub with our friends. The beers were strong and of a very good quality. The girls absolutely enjoyed their wines, which were also of a good quality. Overall it was a very relaxing drinking session, and me, my wife and our daughter had a thoroughly enjoyable occasion.",4
Nice place to sit while kids do the museumWe went in for coffee and sat in the back room. It was lovely and peaceful and nice coffee. Very nice half an hour spent in the warm.,4
Clean and friendly pub3 of us enjoyed a late lunch in a friendly atmosphere. This pub is off the beaten track which is nice and seemed to be filled with locals and not teeming with visitors!,4
"Lovely meal and a fun place to visit before the New year!Visited with my girlfriend before New Years, when we arrived it was very busy as you might expect. We were led upstairs to a double table with another couple, which we thought was strange. We asked if we could sit somewhere else due to the fact we booked weeks in advance, luckily our host found us a table for 2 and apologised to us. The menu is small but has lots of Italian dishes that you can choose from, we had a starter which was Mozzarella garlic bread which was tasty! My girlfriend had pasta and I had a Sausage pizza, which tasted great and was very richh!
The restaurant had lots of Jazz memorabilia and it felt like you were sitting in a jazz museum, had a live band downstairs which gave it an atmosphere.

I would recommend it if you want something different, if you are visiting Greenwich :)",4
AMAZING pizzaProbably the best pizza I've had outside Italy. Crazy amazing decor that will keep you occupied for ages. The only let down (and this is tiny) is the beer selection...but I'm a craft beer / ale snob.,4
"EnjoyableGood experience, good food and service. I would definitely return. Cosy and friendly pub with freshly made pasta.",4
Like a Happy ParadiseFood try Seapasta o Bottarga with a cold Sicilian white wine..don't.forget Octopus in red bread spicy....o...Stinco cooked in the oven rosmarindreams...Fly in Sicily with cassatina and real ricotta cannolo....try this fantastic experience....jazz music...family pub.. Not expensive..thanks Prince..we' ll go back as soon as possible ......In Paradise with pizza diavola off course,5
"Soul pizza pubWelcoming, cozy atmosphere with excellent Italian food accompanied by pleasant jazz music. Among the best in London. I will definitely come back !!",5
"GREAT LIVE JAZZ MUSIC AND MAGIC ATMOSPHEREThe Prince of Greenwich is by all means my favourite local nest where I have been both performing with my band and dining with friends and family on several occasions.
On their Wednesday evenings I have had the pleasure to be singing in the dining area on the upper floor. The atmosphere is unique, laid back and the decor is quirky and Bohemian.. it feels great to be singing live while being surrounded by the so many pictures of the Jazz Masters. The cheerful audience has always been responsive and attentive to the music.
At other times, I have been performing at the weekend on the main bar/dining area and once again the warm welcoming of the audience and friendly staff has been beyond comparison!
Pietro, the owner, welcomed us from day one and made us feel at home every time we were there, fed us with delicious pizza ....(and being Italian myself and loving pizza, this, I must say, enhanced the wonderful experience!)
What else can I say? Performing as a musician at the Prince of Greenwich doesn't feel like working at all but more like having so much fun!!
I'm looking forward to be singing there again in the future!",5
"WeddingI wrote my first review of this pub in December 2015. It has been a brilliant local for us, so good that we decided to have our wedding reception here.

The day was perfect, a six hour Italian banquet of the most delicious food and wine. The upstairs room makes a perfect venue for about 40 people and was great for children too. A play area to do a giant puzzle was perfect so that adults could focus on eating and drinking....

Would thoroughly recommend for a laid back Italian themed wedding meal!",5
Amazing Place!Gorgeous Italian food and lovely wines. We ate upstairs which I would definitely recommend as there was a small jazz band and the singer was fantastic! Staff were exceptionally polite and friendly. There were four of us and we all ordered something different and each meal was first class. I would go back tomorrow if I was still in London! A huge recommendation!,5
"The very prince!I have been in London for a month and I have come to this fantastic pub a lot of times because there is a very Italian atmosphere, the food is delicate. The owners are very welcoming, the staff very kind and helpful.
I tried many typical Sicilian dishes, especially I had the chance to try the Sicilian cassatina and the cannolo in the heart of Greenwich.
If you are in Greenwich you can not go to this pub to have a fresh English beer and a good Italian dish.
thank you so much for the fantastic welcome!
I felt at home.",5
"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTICWe had the pleasure to visit The Prince Of Greenwich, we had a lots of fantastic feedback from friends. This place is just Amazing!! You must vist...good incredible just for 86 pounds 4 of us for a real Italian treats with generous portion.",5
"Great carbonaraDelicious spaghetti carbonara, £10.
London’s friendliest pub run by an engaging Italian family.
The owners greet guests with kisses and hugs, particularly Pietro, the bearded landlord with the twinkling eyes.
Lovely staff, including Nicole, who serves the food.
Decorated with flair, you can’t miss the rhino head...it’s like Jumanji meets EastEnders-like boozer meets Italian flair.
It’s unique...guaranteed you’ve never experienced a pub like it before.",5
Cool placeLovely pub and lovely decorations. The staff is amazing and the owners are incredible! I highly recommend the cassatina. If you ever visit Greenwich and you want to try some delicious traditional Italian food you should stop at the Prince of Greenwich.,5
"Amazing Food and Super Friendly ServiceMy wife and I visited on Friday night and left absolutely stuffed full of wonderful Italian Pizza and Pasta. Seafood pasta was superb! Only advice I would give is not to order too much as the portions are very generous. Owners and their family were very friendly as were the rest of their staff. Two starters, two main and two rounds of drinks for £60 you can’t go wrong!",5
"Lacked common senseAfter reading it's very high reviews I was excited to visit with some friends and their baby. After forking out for quite expensive parking we arrived to find that our pre-booked table was not suitable. I had booked a table for 4 adults and 2 babies, the restaurant had failed to provide us with an adequate seating location and had given the high chairs to a family that had walked in not 5 minutes before we arrived. The excuse was poor, they said sorry it's a very busy day for babies. I felt that considering it was listed as child and baby friendly it should have had ample high chairs or at least been honest about the arrangements when confirming our booking. Please look further afield to avoid disappointment.",1
"Disgusting hygeineHi Bill! I'm very sorry about this situation. It is true I got confused with bookings as the table that arrived just before you had the exact number of people (5 adults and 2 babies) and were not too sure about the name on their reservation, so I ended up giving them our last 2 highchairs (that were reserved for you). That said, we had plenty of room to accommodate your group comfortably, I just need another minute to organise the situation that's why I kindly asked you to wait by the green sofa while your friends had not arrived yet. Highchairs are not a problem as we have a very good relationship with our neighbour pubs, I was about to go there and borrow a couple. You just didn't give me the chance to do so.
I think there was miscommunication due to my English, that's all.
You are welcome to come visit us again!

"Worst birthday everThe courtyard at the back of the pub is disgusting. Broken glass and food just thrown on the ground. Overflowing rubbish bins, fat in the gutters, an old fridge and food waste in open supermarket carrier bags which must be attracting vermin. One can only imagine what the kitchen must be like. Had we seen all this before we ate there we would most certainly have dined elsewhere.",1
"Disappointingthank you for telling me that our common courtiyard is dirty but my bins are the small blue ones next to my bycicles on the left so the clean ones..i do not know who you are but for you having access to that area you must be one of the people working in this courtyard..so what happened? do you know who did that mess? usually us and health center really care for the area. where you upset and you hang around pushing and throwing waste on the floor?
anyway i do not think that you did the right thing discussing problems between neighbors or maybe with the council or generally bin collectors which have nothing to do with the pub ( which has 5 in hygene rating) in a public site . it seems to me that you are doing this in purpose
trying to put down our business . i felt this move unfair and not professional therefore i asked to trip to consider this a fraud. anyway we love our small little pub and our kitchen is an open kitchen..everybody can see it.... Paola and Pietro",1
"The most unwelcoming pub in LondonAfter reading all the wonderful reviews on Tripsdvisor I’ve decided to book for my husband’s birthday day out as we went to cinema nearby. I understand that this is pub not a restaurant but still I would expect my small request when I’ve done reservation to write “happy Birthday” on my husband’s desert plate to be done, at least some small surprise. Instead of that waitress asked him just when we were seated “is it your birthday ?“ , my husband said yes, she said “happy birthday “... and that was it. I still don’t understand what was the point of that question...it was really intrusive, all I’ve asked is just to make a little note for him on his special day. It was only 3 tables in the pub so they could prepare that desert plate and give us some special attention. Absolutely embarrassing I felt when we left. Ruined day. So don’t be fooled by good reviews, it’s just a pub with ok Italian food, nothing much, believe me I’m Londoner.",1
"Fantastic decor - shame about the food...Went to this place to eat after a friend had recommended it. There were 8 of us, two are vegetarians, so we ordered 8 ""Gourmet tasting menus"", with 2 to be vegetarian. It started off well enough, with acceptable veggie and meat lasagnes, then a veggie calzone. Nice, but hardly ""gourmet"". Everything arrived in rotation, so you ate what you wanted and then it was taken away - you couldn't have any later.
Then came more pasta with cheese, gnocchi with cheese, and 2 meat pastas with cheese, until one of our party pleaded ""no more pasta, please!"". Then some beef arrived. This meant that the last 3 dishes to arrive were not suitable for vegetarians (even though the waitress said that one was, it had minced meat in it), so 2 of us sat with nothing to eat. Mind you, we were stuffed by then anyway..
In summary, 7 dishes; 4 were pasta and cheese, one gnocchi and cheese, one calzone and one beef. Hardly ""gourmet"". I was desperate for a vegetable!
Pudding was really disappointing - 4 profiteroles and 4 cannolis, which we had to cut in half. Mind you, my heart was already protesting at all the stodge and cheese, so I wasn't really inclined for any pastry and cream/mascapone.
£18 for a ""gourmet"" meal that was, essentially, pasta and cheese? I don't think it really represents value for money.",2
"Pleasant but chaotic !Booked a table for two for Saturday at 19.00 . We arrived dead on time ,the place was packed . People who were just drinking were occupying the tables that had bits of paper with reserved written on them . We were asked to wait while the friendly drinkers hogged the tables . We were eventually given a small table by the door and by what turned out to be v near where the musicians were going to set up their equipment .
We ordered two pizzas and two small salads . The pizzas turned out to be pannini style flatbreads with no tomato topping . The sort that cost £1.50 each in Tesco . They tasted acceptable . These two pizzas with topping cost £26 !!!!!
The £4 side salad was a few green leaves and two cherry tomatoes . With drinks the total bill was £ 40 .

"Lovely food but the service left a bitter taste in our mouths...So I came here in April for my birthday and had a wonderful time. I really enjoyed the food and the service was good. Therefore when a friends birthday came around I immediately thought of the place. I called and booked as there were a few of us and everything seemed fine.

We arrived and all seemed well - being a very hot day we wanted to order some drinks but found that any bottled drinks we ordered were really warm (beer, sparkling water). We asked if we could have some cold drinks to which we were given a wine cooler for our beer. This issue - although dealt with wasn’t really acknowledged effectively by the staff as a problem.

Anyway, I just wanted to enjoy the food as I knew how lovely it is. So we waited and waited, (fair enough it was quite busy) but the food took over an hour to come which did surprise me. However when it did come it was delicious and we all very much enjoyed it. I can’t really complain about that!

During this entire time we did notice the staff appeared very jumpy and there was an odd atmosphere but we were having a nice time. They kept asking us if we wanted drinks only to find we had just ordered etc - appeared to be a lacking in communication between servers?
Two of our party had to leave (one left his share in cash with me and the other went to pay hers at the bar as she had card). Meanwhile we decided to order some after dinner cocktails. The waiter took our order however about 5 minutes later another waitress returned to let us know it was too late to have them. There wasn’t really an apology about this which I found quite odd. This seemed strange and she seemed very stressed by us being there. So we said ok and asked for the bill - planning on going to a local pub.
I am a GM in hospitality so I know exactly how this kind of bill splitting works and I do it all the time. But for some reason even though we only wanted to split it between a few people this became impossible for the servers. In the end we spent over 1/2 an hour attempting to understand what the issue with paying separately was. I felt really awful for the waitress (not sure if she was a manager or supervisor) as she was getting visibly upset but I don’t really understand why. We booked a large table and I know how normal it is for people to split the bill. This is common place for most restaurants but it seemed an impossibility for Purezza.
Ultimately we got one of our party to pay the bill and we all paid them back but it just seemed an awful lot of stress for not much reason. I don’t know whether they had just been having a bad day but I really felt like the service seemed as though it was falling apart and this really affected my experience.",2
"Not great I'm afraidWe ordered the gluten free Marguerita pizza and lasagne, neither were particularly nice I'm sorry to say.",3
"Food is amazing, unlike the shift managerI went to the restaurant with my boyfriend on Friday 20th, we were waiting to be called to a table for ten minutes, and then a man and a woman walked in, said hi to the shift manager (obviously knowing him) and asked for a table for two, whilst ignoring me and bf.

At this point I told the manager ""excuse me, we have been waiting here for ten minutes before these people"", the shift manager was a bit surprised, but he said while smirking ""don't worry, we can accommodate all of you"".

The manager took us to the first floor and set us in the corner in what seems to be ""a punishment table"", a table that is being blocked by walls with literally no space to more.

Then the couple that cut us in line got a very spacious couch table, this act was too obvious to ignore, so my bf and I just moved to a vacant table nearby.

Then we waited for the food ""forever"" whilst the couple the cut us in line got their food before us, at some the manager came to us and told us that we need to leave at 8 because the table is booked, this seemed a bit weird since you cannot book table for four, which is where we were sitting, and also we were still waiting for the food to arrive (it was 7:30 PM).

When the food finally arrived, it didn't taste good because of bad service we received, that I just wanted to get out of there.

I must say the waiters were lovely and friendly, it was only the shift manager that had an attitude towards us, and basically he wanted us to leave the place ASAP.",3
"Tasty but misleading menuWe’ll start with the good things:
The pizzas are tasty, large, and filling. The toppings are varied and original.
The not so good? Misleading menu. I hope my picture here shows the problem, because honestly none of us four has spotted the extra £2.50 for the hemp and gluten free based.
When we ordered, the waiter had asked what base we were choosing. We asked him to recommend so he said the hemp base was the best. So we went for it. Now while it’s “on the menu” - as they said, the waiter didn’t mention that it’s extra cost, and the ‘small letters’ were way too small. What’s more, instead of a clear £ sign they put a + sign, which makes it even harder to detect. When we challenged the waiter on this extra charge, he admitted that they’re instructed not to tell customers that they charge more for hemp / GF based.
So just to advise you to bring a microscope to ensure you can read the oh so tiny fonts with a plus sign instead of a pound one.",3
"Great Vegan Pizza!Overall the best vegan pizza I've had in London, its such a bonus to have vegan cheese available. The vegan mozzarella was the best I've ever had. The dough was lovely. My partner had a pizza with ricotta- but the portion on the pizza was huge, and as the consistency was so wet it made the pizza very soggy. There is a lot of salt in the pizzas- I put salt on every meal but this was too much for me. It really overrode the freshness of the ingredients and I couldnt taste any of the tomatoes in the sauce. We all came away super thirsty!
Service was attentive and the location great! We will give it another go for sure, no one else seems to have mentioned the saltiness so maybe it was an off day.",3
"If you like a thin and crispy base this isnt for youService was good,

Pizza was ok i uess. Too doughy and too much crust. Had a hemp dough which was heavy, not much ""pizza"" on there. Mrs had sourdough which was better. Utlimately this is not a proper pizza, but for a vegan option is not bad. Not my first choice but for the mrs who is vegan i had to suck it up.

Each slice was only 2 bites and the rest was pure dough",3
"Sadly disappointingI was expecting the best vegan pizza ever.. My expectations were super high and I was so disappointed. I got the fumosa pizza and thought the flavours didn't really fit together... Also, the barbecue sauce had a weird taste. The pizza dough was great thought, great flavour, soft and chewy. The staff qas friendly as well. Maybe I will give it a second chance at some point..",3
"Looks amazing, tastes bland.I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant having seen photos of it on instagram!

So my friends and I decided to go for Sunday dinner.

I ordered the BBQ pizza and they both had the lasagne.

Now it looked pretty impressive but the flavours didn’t go together very well and the bbq sauce was very sickly. I ended up eating only some of it.

We did try the mozzarella balls and they were really tasty.

Perhaps it was just my pizza, but it was rather doughy and lacked flavour.

Sad times.",3
"Positive first vegan experience.Recommended by a colleague, we stepped in with contrasting expectations...
We stepped out satisfied, sated but not full: that is what a good restaurant should do and that is what Purezza does.
Amazing cocktails and pizza, desserts are ok.

Thumb up for the staff too: Federica makes you feel home.

Prices definitely below the average...and for a better pizza!",4
"Great Pizza!I’ve been wanting to go to Purezza forever so I was pleased when they announced they were opening a branch in London.
I came here with my boyfriend and our (non-vegan) friend. We started by sharing the cheesy mozzarella balls. The waitress warned us they were hot in the middle and I’m glad she did otherwise we would have burned our mouths! The cheese tasted good but the consistency was a bit too liquidy which made them very messy to eat.
Me and my boyfriend then shared two pizzas; he opted for the Cheesus which has lots of different vegan cheeses on it and I had the special which had sausage and wild broccoli with a white base. The pizzas were both great and the homemade cheese was really good! The dough was tasty (it’s a very soft base) and there were a decent amount of toppings on both pizzas. I was also impressed with the flavour of the tomato sauce as that can often let a pizza down. The portion size was good and I left feeling happy and full.
The waiting staff were attentive and friendly. The only issue was how hot it was in the restaurant. I noticed they had air con units but the whole front of the restaurant was open which renders them pretty ineffective. I know they can’t control the weather though.",4
"Loooong wait but great food - worth it maybe???I booked a table for 6 of us at 8pm for my vegan brother’s 18th birthday and despite knowing this the shift manager patronisingly told me “I’ll have a look, darling” before completely ignoring us and leaving us to wait. I asked again 10 minutes later and he told us it would be a 10/15 minute wait and no apology. At 8:45, not 10 but another 35(!!!) minutes later, we were finally seated upstairs. The table was extremely tight wedged into the corner, meaning that 3 people had to vacate their seats if the person next to them needed the toilet. I would not recommend the restaurant if you’re not skeletons as you might not have enough room. Finally the food arrived and it was very good, everyone enjoyed it and they gave us the dessert for free to make up for the wait. Perhaps just visit at a very quiet time and don’t go for special occasions. The waitress was lovely so thank you to her for making up for the rude and obnoxious shift manager - who I’ve also noticed has been commented about on here before - perhaps another career would suit you better because your host skills leave a lot to be desired.",4
"Great food, not so great serviceI have been to Purezza a couple of times before and the food is really amazing, I'd say it's probably the best vegan pizza I've found in London so far. The menu has a good range of options including a gluten free dough for those who want it (at a little extra cost).

The only issue I can identify is that the service quality can be a little bit hit or miss depending on who is working on a given shift. many of the waiters/waitresses are extremely helpful, positive and welcoming.

However on my latest visit the shift manager was particularly rude to me and my partner. We were left with the impression that he was hurrying us to leave the restaurant, even coming at one point to tell us that we would need to leave by 8pm because he needed the table we were sat at. This was despite the fact that there were other tables of the same capacity where people were finishing their meal while we hadn't even received our food (this was at 7.30).

We rushed to finish eating once our food actually arrived and went to pay at which point we discovered that their payment system had crashed and they were not letting people in to the restaurant (which begs the question why he 'needed our table') We were then asked to pay with cash, told that they could not give change and that we therefore would have to pay the exact amount.

None of the staff seemed to have any idea what to do, or how to manage the situation; least of all the shift manager who seemed to be completely inept.

I would definitely recommend people visit for the food, however just be aware that sometimes the service can be a little lacking.",4
"Great pizza, not great servicePizza is absolutely amazing, I can’t eat dairy so it is a god send. Service is a bit of a shambles though - I feel like they weren’t prepared to be as successful as they have been so are seriously understaffed. Go for the food but don’t expect good service.",4
"I would go again, but order something differentI'd really like to come back and try Purezza London again, as all of my vegan friends said it was the nicest vegan pizza they'd ever had... but on the day I went I didn't think it was mind-blowing like I had been told. However, it was a VERY busy Saturday lunchtime around Easter that I was there, so maybe the kitchen was quite stretched. We also asked for a jug of water, and they didn't bring it to us until after we had finished our meal (!)
I got the pizza with the white base and the potato on (friends choice to share). It was kind of just like a very, very salty garlic flatbread with potato. I wouldn't order that one again, I'd like to try one of the tomato sauce based ones next time. I was looking around at the other people's orders and getting major food envy.
We also got the vegan lasagne, which was nice but it very stodgy!
I would come back here again, but would definitely order something different.",4
"Amazing pizza but service wasn't greatHey Emma, thanks for the comments and feedback - it's always appreciated as we're always looking to improve. It sounds like you visited a little while ago during one of our first opening weekends (we opened in late March). There's no beating around the bush - we had a few hiccups here and there when we first opened which we've ironed out now and everything's running smoothly. Next time we'll strive to hit the full 5 stars for you, and we very much look forward to seeing you at Purezza again soon. #PlantPioneers",4
"My new favourite vegan pizzaThe food is so good, and I would recommend to anyone! I took my non vegan friend and she thought it was great too!
Unfortunately for anything we needed we had to go find staff - we had a long wait and no one even came over to introduce themselves as our waiter. I'd give them another chance but it was a shame!",4
"Love it!I’m glad we made the special journey to Camden to give Purezza a try. A real treat if you are vegan.

We ordered the couch potato (exchanging a couple of the toppings), a marinara and a margarita on the whole grain sourdough. All three of the pizzas were wonderful. The dough was light yet filling and did not leave us bloated. A little oily but we didn’t mind that as the taste was really good. I ended up eating a bit of paper which I cut through as I sliced my pizza but I guess I should be more careful!

The couch potato was beautifully creamy. They make the ‘cheese’ themselves which is a bonus if you are trying to stay away from processed foods.

The Mac and cheese although highly recommended was not to our liking (overly cheesy and an after taste of onion powder) but we’ll definitely go back for the pizza.

The service is on the slow side and it took some time for our food to arrive but the staff were all really nice and helped to answer all of our questions.

We left feeling stuffed for a little over £25! Very reasonable as the kids pizza was free!

The place was full for a Tuesday evening. A good place to visit for a vegan treat.",4
"Great vegan pizza!Our dairy allergic daughter was so existed. We ate 3 times in one week. Welcoming, And excellent service",5
BEST VEGAN PIZZAI’m not a vegan but I like to try new food! This was an incredible experience - they have a large range to choose from. The tofu on the pizzas has an amazing smoked flavour and there’s all sorts of bases you can pick! I’ll deff be going back!,5
"Delectable vegan pizzaWent to Purezza with my husband and a friend on Saturday. All of us are vegan and found it hard to choose from the tempting items on the menu. We got 3 different pizzas to share between us along with a lovely fresh salad and some garlic mayo. We all thoroughly enjoyed the food, gorgeous bases and interesting flavours on the toppings that were delicious. None of us had room for puddings, maybe we will try them on our next visit. Seating upstairs was comfy but quite cramped. Waiting staff were very helpful and kept our water topped up regularly without being asked. We'll definitely be back!",5
"Possibly the best pizza I've ever eaten... vegan or otherwise!Who would have thought beetroot on Pizza would work? Please, please, please continue to roll out other Purezza locations throughout the UK! I would travel from Bristol to London just for the pizza but it'd be great to have somewhere a bit closer! The staff are awesome too by the way. I cannot express how much I love this place.",5
"Amazing vegan pizzeria!Today I have been invited by Love Pop Ups London to try out the plant-based, vegan pizzeria Purezza in Camden, London. This fresh company serves up Italian classics with a modern twist, all their recipes are plant based and vegan, with many gluten-free and some raw food options as well.
￼
This gorgeous restaurant is on a mission to make healthy food options as delicious and beautiful as possible. They hand make all their vegan cheeses in house, from their absolutely stunning brown rice mozzarella, over coconut and cashew cheeses, to a delectable tofu ricotta, everything is dairy-free and tasty.
We started out with courgetti spaghetti, a raw food dish made from courgette, creamy pesty, sundried tomatoes, and a vegan parmesan topping, as well as a gluten-free mac and cheese side dish. The pasta was a little on the chewy side, but the taste was absolutely spot on! With a cheesy, creamy sauce that cheese lover’s dreams are made of, this vegan dish packs an unexpected flavour punch.
￼
With three bases to choose from, everyone can find their perfect pizza at Purezza! The classic sourdough crust is super fluffy and light with that tangy sourdough taste that pairs so perfectly with cheese. Unfortunately the middle of the pizza is a little soggy for my taste, but it’s the traditional Italian way, so this is not something I can fault the restaurant for. We also tried the hemp crust, which is a little more dense and savoury than the classic and pairs well with more flavourful toppings.
￼
We tried the Cheesus, and the Couch Potato pizzas. The former comes with four different vegan cheeses on a tomato base, especially the huge dollops of ricotta are to die for! Personally, I found the yellow cheese a little too sticky in texture, almost like those fake cheese slices, but all other cheeses on this glorious pizza were amazing.
The potato pizza was more flavourful, with spiced Seitan cutlets, roast potatoes and smoked aubergine on a white base. I thought the toppings would have been more suited to a bbq style sauce, though it was a very delicious pizza as well! Paired with the pesto dip, it’s fantastic!
￼
For dessert we had a beautifully creamy, plant-based creme brulee and a dense, rich chocolate brownie with vegan gelato. Both desserts were not too sweet and rounded off our meal just perfectly with rich flavour and delicate textures.
￼
There is so much to choose from on the menu, and with many raw food and gluten free options, everyone is guaranteed to find something they like. And as another bonus, kids eat free at this restaurant!
We really enjoyed our beautiful meal and I can absolutely recomment this vegan pizzeria, it’s delicious! ",5
"The best pizza EVER, vegan or not!I ate here with friends last night; two of us vegan and two who eat everything! We waited half an hour for a table but had a drink in the bar in the meantime. We shared starters, had mains and shared desserts. The food was AMAZING. Garlic bread was the best ever and we chose the option with five dips which we then saved to dip our pizza crusts in. Non-vegans had the mac n’ cheese and declared it better than the dairy cheese version. Three of us had pizzas and one the calzone - all were wonderful but none of us could finish them so we took leftovers home. The size is perfect if you’re really hungry and haven’t had starters maybe! Flavours were intense, there was the right amount of cheese, the food looked great too. I had the Portabello with lots of mushrooms on the hemp base... The description of the hemp base doesn’t sound that appealing but try it, it’s super-tasty, I’ll have it next time. For desserts, the tiramisu and brownie were very good, quite modest portion size for the brownie but we were stuffed by then and just curious to try so in fact it was ideal. The Oreo Pizza is actually on a pizza base, which we didn’t expect from the description, and we were so pizzaed-out by then we could hardly eat any, so that’s a treat for today! Service was friendly and knowledgeable - a bit slow but we were sat in the little upstairs area and maybe forgotten at times, but it wasn’t a problem as we weren’t in a hurry at all. I can’t recommend highly enough for all pizza fans to try this place. Our non vegan friends had totally forgotten while eating that it was a vegan restaurant!",5
"SIMPLY AWESOME!!I never thought a vegan pizza would taste so much better than ordinary pizza! Dairy free smoked mozzarellaaaa - say whaaat???!!! :)) Pizza was amazing, staff super friendly! Going back ASAP :))",5
"One of the best pizza's we have ever had.On coming to the UK, we had set out to get to Purezza before we leave, after I had heard such great reviews. We were not disappointed. The pizza was amazing! The staff, especially Marco, who took our orders and served us, was great and he was careful to explain everything to us. We had one of the special's Pizza and the Furmosa Pizza. For dessert; the Oreo pizza ( which is super decadent and life changing) and the gelato. We wish we could keep going back even with just a couple of days left for our trip. Thanks for such a wonderful time Purezza.",5
"Great little place in the heart of LondonThis restaurant is 100% Vegan which a dream come true for me , its has authentic Naples style pizza with many dough to choose from wether you like Hemp or wholegrain they have it. Its reasonably prices for London center and please don't forget to order the Brownie with vanilla ice cream unbeatable Vegan desert, the staff are very friendly and helpful although i recommend that they change the presentation of the Tiramisu and the Coleslaw. I hope one day that they can use 100% Organic ingredients, also have more variety of Pizza. If you are Raw vegan they do have a reasonable options of Raw Pizza and Raw deserts, also i would recommend the cheesbclls if you are a bit junky like me. Godd Luck & GO VEGAN",5
"Come hungry and eat everything!This place seems almost too good to be true - there are just sooo many tasty sounding options on the menu, that are all vegan. How can it be real?! I don't know how they do it, but believe me - it's all as good as it sounds! We had pizzas, beers and desserts and walked away very satisfied.

The vegan cheese is particularly good. Vegan cheese can often be a little odd, but this stuff hit the spot.

We were two vegans and one omnivore and we all enjoyed the meal. I can't wait to go back!",5
"Tinned sauceOrdered a tikka masala dish through deliveroo and it was awful. The sauce tasted nothing like tikka masal, it was very sweet, no consistency- i'm pretty sure it was not home made but out of a tin!
will never order again",1
"take awayDear Sarachoo,

We can not say we are perfect, no one is. But this is 5th feedback with terrible rating ( all from takeouts and all sort of untraceable source.. co incidence?? we are not very sure.
We always say that we genuinely care and try to put things right if it has gone wrong..
Just a wishful thinking that people (if genuine) who are capable to put negative feedback be considerate enough to go through all the positives and give us a call to try to put things right. rather than carry out smear campaign.. but we guess that would have been the case if it was genuine anyway.
Kind Regards,
Team Monkey Temple",1
What's the fuss all about?sorry the food was crap and cold by the time i got the meat was not cooked properly too much hype turned out to be crap dont bother,1
"AwfulDear K1R,

We are writing you with all good wishes in our heart. Way you have been posting in multiple media sites with no clues to when and what you had ordered indicates that your intentions are solely bringing disrepute to our establishment. We have had few similar instances earlier to and we know by now that we can only wonder what exactly reporting these to admin yields. However, we thank you for taking time to write about us be it negative. We believe in ourselves ans we know deep down that we have been true to our effort. As long as we can make you happy ( even if by bearing brunt of your anger..........)
we think we have fulfilled our obligation. Hope you found peace in your heart

"DreadfulI've passed this restaurant many times and it's always full or half full. 4 of us decided to try it one Saturday night. 2 Indians, one Pakistani and a Punjabi. We ordered the dumplings, okra, prawns and Thali. The dumplings were almost raw, the prawns had a strange soapy taste to them okra was in a sweet tomato sauce and the thali was very very bland. The service was outstanding so no complaints there. The waiters are keen to get feed back and we were honest. They suggested we had chosen the wrong dishes. Maybe so but I'm not risking it again.",1
"TOO SMALL and the food is OK the price is too HIGHI am sorry but this restaurant is OK its too cramp plus the food is mediocre. Also for that price indian Zinc or Bombay chilli is better on the King street Hammersmith and NO i am not getting paid to say that as i am vegetarian i like my food sorry not happy.
Not a cool place just the name is cool",2
"Not worshipping at this temple again any time soonDear Shashmann,
It would be our first response on slight negative note. We always take our reviews very seriously and we do treat yours no differently however we have to point out very sternly that your review does not feels genuine as for following reason hence has been flagged to tripadvisor admins.
you said our restaurant is cramped:
We do accept our restaurant is pretty small but we have sacrificed much of possible number of chairs to make it feel cosy and comfortable...

you said for the price indian Zing or Bombay chilli?? is better..
Let us point you out that price difference with indian zing is almost 3 folds and bombay chilli doesnt even exists in hammersmith.

If you really have had bad night with us we urge you to contact us and speak to us so we can investigate further. Although we believe in sorting out any issues there and then, we are more than ready to keep an open mind about it and accept maybe you are one that we somehow missed out. And we could work out on real problem if any exists

P.s. This is not an angry reply. After careful consideration we came to this conclusion
that we have to address such allegation with readily available facts.
Kind Regards,
Team Monkey Temple",2
"Did not live up t expectations after reading good reveiwsI really wanted to love this place, which is very local, but just can't do it. Possibly the worst Indian meal i've ever had except for something execrable in the back streets of Exeter in the early 70s. My auntie Vera could have done better with a Vesta pack and one small box of sultanas. Where to start? The Popadums were really salty, The Chicken Ko-Sa had some taste, but the spices hadn't really cooked down properly and finding the chicken pieces was a Bear Grylls challenge all on its own. As for 'enriched with lemon and almonds' we couldn't taste either. So that would be an impoverishment of lemon and almonds then. The Lamjung Lamb had a pleasant coconut after taste but the meat was flaccid and oddly greyish. The Bhindi Bhajee was firm and tasty but sadly not enough to make us forget the other disappointments. A neighbour and devotee of the temple assures us one of the chefs is much better than the other - but apparently the good one was on when we tried their food. Come on guys, pull it together. I'd love to see you succeed! Really pleasant staff. Please give them something to be proud of.",2
"Distinctly average experienceDear Nova F,
This is really disheartening to read the reviews that basically has got issues with whole of the menu... as it is extremely rare for us. It is puzzling to hear such harsh words on food as over 98% of our guests absolutely love them and remaining ones if has some problem would have issue with 1 or 2 particular ones. And it is quite evident by all the reviews and testimonial around on our various social media pages and other reviewing sites. Saying that we understand uniqueness of palate with each guests and appreciate what you had might not have been suitable for yours. Hence for that reason we always encourage our guests to speak their mind while they are in restaurant so we could fix the problem and send them home with smiles.
however, Please accept our apologies for failing your expectations. We as a front of house team take full responsibilities on this one for failing to capture your dissatisfaction and make amends. Regarding the quality we assure you that for the price range we always have and always will give the highest quality.
We urge you to visit us and speak out your expectations and will try our foremost to meet them.
Kind Regards,
Team Monkey Temple",2
Nice environment expecting moreThe music is nice and also the atmosphere. I'd suggest this restaurant for couples. About wines I like the choice (not huge)of wines with cork. I tried Nepalese dishes expecting to eat more meat and less sauces. Easy to spend 70 pounds eating nan with sauces and wine. They have opportunity to improve to deliver something really amazing .... I cross fingers for them to listen customer voice.,3
"Excellent food slow serviceDear PatrickDS,

It is encouraging to see a review starting on a positive note. Thank you for your honest feedback and your honest suggestion to improve. We do seriously take our guests feedback on try to work on them. It seems that you were bit disappointed with pieces of meat in curry, we truly are very sorry for that. We will look into the matter and have word with both kitchen and service team. There should have been enough pieces of meat and in case by mistake kitchen team failed on that, Service team must have identified and then rectified the problem. On issue of wine out of 7 red wines we have on our menu Barolo Fontanafredda, Humberto Canale Malbec and Louis Tete Beajoulais - Village are cork top, Similarly we have white wines like Rioja Blanco Vina cerrada and Russian River Pinot gris are cork top choices. We still are trying to shake off our Bring your own image from days we were not licensed so you can count on us to widen our wine variety slowly. Once again our sincere apologies on not being able to fully satisfy you for this visit and hope you will give us another chance to impress you at dMonkey Temple.

"TripAdvisor FailVisited on a wet Friday night with friends. Warm welcome. Seated immediately as had booked, no possibility otherwise. Poppadoms came straight away then the slow slow service started. The staff were working flat out always smiling no fuss but everything was slow!!! Was not a particular issue as chatting but could be so much better.",3
"Above average for its genreDear Helen,
Thank you so much your custom. Our sincere apologies for the slow service. however, we assure you that it was one off event as we had one of the biggest boom of order in short time. Not that it should have affected the service, and we are looking for the ways to avoid it in future. furthermore, when you left we were still trying to cope with pressure hence failed to do amends before you left. we are aware of the problem and would like to make up for it. Please, give us a call and we will arrange something for your next visit.
Kind Regards,
Team Monkey Temple.",3
"Nepal meets Shehperd's BushFreshly prepared Nepalese influenced dishes in a contemporary, boutique interior.

I had the Chicken Gurkha specifically because it was marked as Extremely Hot, and although this was very tasty, it was only mildly spicy. My partner had the Mixed Vegetable Curry which she said was excellent.

Good food and good service.",4
"Great place for a family curryDear Guest,

"Food with friends/ familyThe service is always extremely friendly and patient with our kids. The curries are tasty, good for kids, adults might want a little bit more richness, but we love visiting this warm and welcoming place.",4
"Very satisfiedDear Wayne,
Thank you very much for your kind words and more importantly, your continued custom. We are delighted to learn that you loved our service. We are team that mostly includes very dedicated dads of young children. Hence, we are able to relate with parents with young children. Regarding the curries, it is hugely subjective issues and we are very flexible to each guests palate.

So when you order next please let us know and we will try to utmost to please you with your kind of taste.

"Not badI love Indian type of food so we thought we'd try this restaurant in Shepherds Bush as we were staying in the area. It's a small place but I'm glad we phoned ahead to book a table as it soon filled up during the evening. This restaurant sold alcohol but didn't mind if you took your own so we did. The food was hot, spicey & flavoursome. A good local restaurant that also does takeaways.",4
"Great Napalese foodDear Jan,
Thank you for your custom and your fabulous review. We are delighted that you enjoyed your experience at the Monkey Temple yet we understand that there is room for an improvement as we have not been able to gather full star off you. Please help us by letting us know which aspect you think should be focused on, as we definitely aspire to be more than just a good local restaurant. from what we have heard and experienced in past three years we have started to believe that we do have potential for such and we promise to work harder to get there.
Once again we appreciate your encouragement.

"Relax and enjoy!!We had Chicken Gurka, Yellow lentils with spinach, Potato's cooked in Kathmandu style and chili Momos. Food was very nice, couldn't fault. Not your standard Indian curry joint with a Nepali twang! Staff and the owner are also very courteous and attentive.
Chef / kitchen puts in of of efforts to make their deserts stand out and unique.

Good place for Nepali food or a good curry!",4

Tasty indian foodI was staying in the area so I decided to get a delivery unfortunately it took over an hour to arrive. They did give me a couple free cans of coke to compensate but I was sooo hungry. The food was o.k. but nothing special and a little pricey but I can't say don't go there as it was definitely adequate.,4
"Not the usual menu, nicely made, good flavours.Dear Jane S,
First of all let us thank you for taking time out to give us feedback.. We really appreciate it. We are sorry that there was a delay delivering your food. We hope someday we will be able to serve you again and prove you otherwise regarding food. As we believe, frustration of receiving food late definitely can take away some of the enjoyment factor and may be that is what happened with you. Just hoping someday.

The food was incredible - fantastic flavours, great quality and generous portions. The staff were welcoming, attentive and friendly. The restaurant is relatively small but still felt spacious.

"The perfect packageDelicious food served in good proportions and at a good price. London has its pros and cons and finding a good restaurant is one of its cons, but this restaurant is one of the really good restaurants that are hard to find in London.

"Sunday lunchI was with friends for sunday roast , the food was terrible beef teaste like rubber chicken in the middle was raw ,gravy like water ,food no seasoned ( hospital food) what’s the worst thing waiter smell alcohol I will never come back",1
"I don't know if they were sausages or human fingersI ordered the bangers and mash and was presented with three tiny chipolatas, some instant mashed potato and a bowl of gravy. I bit into the first sausage and I actually wondered if I was munching on a severed human finger due to how hard and overcooked it was. I managed to push through and eat the lot because I was so hungry and we had to wait for more than half an hour for the food. 100% would not go back or recommend to anyone.",1
"What the...After exploring London all day my husband and myself stopped by this place and saw that they had bangers and mash. Restaurant/drinking area was busy so thought we were onto a winner. 30 minutes after ordering we finally received what I can only discribe as disappointment on a plate. Three of the smallest, overcooked sausages on a plate smothered with gravy. They also forgot the onion rings on my dish and when mentioned, the boy quickly returned with two onion rings. I will note that I have seen looked at other people's photos of their dishes and it looks like they may have run out of the normal sausages they use. If this were the case then perhaps a few extra sausages should be served and the customer notified...",2
"Cute, but not that greatJust to make it clear, we did not go there for drinks, We actually went there for some Fish and Chips. The place is old, kind of cute, but quite generic. The food was average, nothing special at all. The only positive about this pub would have to be the people working there. You can really tell they enjoy themselves and are super friendly to all the visitors. Don't think i will be going back again as there are other better options for Fish and Chips.",2
ScampiI ordered scampi and chips. It came with a salad. The food tasted below average and easily forgotten. The place looked run down. It's not a place I would recommend.,2
"DisappointedAfter eager anticipation we went for lunch here expecting an authentic British pub experience. .. drinks were nice, food had a Spanish/ Indian flare yet hardly traditional fare. Fish and Chips were over battered with a curry overpowering flavor. Skin was left on and was wet & slimy... Ewe!!",2

Celebrating my mothers life in a great pubLooked up restaurants around us after visiting imperial war museum late Thursday afternoons and came across this pub due to its reviews we decided to go in took around 10 minutes before one of the customers told us that they don't do food till 6pm still no sight of the waitress so we went to the main side there she was talking to this man who looked well over his limits in a rush she served us and dashed back to carry on her conversations like we had interrupted dint even reply after I enquired of the food menu we when my colleagues went to the second round of drinks she was out of sight again by this time we had already figured out things were not as the were by her frequent visits to the toilets and the garden with quite a lot of exchanging hands with a few of the customers so am surprised by the reviews of this being a family pub especially the encounter I had when I went out for a cigarette to cut a long story short it was such a disgrace to be in this place and am glad no kids were around and I think the manager should look into this very carefully as this seemed to start from the inside later on there was a member of staff who took over and asked us AT THE TABLE (contrary to the other) if we wanted food but as tempting as the menu was we had a terrible experience and we left,2
"British pub near the imperial war museumConvenient option if you are looking for food after visiting the museum, especially on a Sunday when there are not much options around. Food was ok, nothing too exciting, but staple British pub food options.",3
"Good Fish & ChipsGood fish and chips but average English pub, not sure it's worth the trip unless you are in the neighborhood.",3
OkVisited here on Tuesday after on our way to the museum quite old fashioned the drinks n food was ok but Hayley that served us could have done with some personal hygiene was quite friendly but her body odour was a real put off came across as a commission based service too full on too friendly but food was ok,3
"Traditional Pub with average foodWe had dinner at the pub o the basis of Tripadvisor reviews. We had a warm welcome in surroundings that I had not seen in many years - an old fashioned local but with modern additions, like the two big TV's on the wall. I have to say the foood was disappointing although the portions were big. My chips were oustanding but the fish was tired and I am not keen to have it served on a bed of salad - nothing traditional about that. My partner's saussages were ok but served on a bed of mash swimming in gravy.",3
"Nice pubThank you very much for taking the time to write a review. I am terribly sorry to read that you food was not up to standard,
We take great pride in our food and drink and this negative review is taking extremely seriously. We thank you once again for your feedback.",3
Kitchen was closed at 3:30I wanted a pub near the downtown and close to the metro station and i got this one Nice welsh food too,3
"UK Pub Crawl Stop #1Located a couple of blocks from Victoria Station, this little corner pub is definitely a locals hangout. Fun bartender and really good Shepherd’s pie just add to the atmosphere.",4
"searching for a decent sunday lunchrenovated since the last time I went there much better now . went for sunday lunch, food was very good and beer was a reasonable price and also very good. management was very friendly",4
The real British Pub atmosphereTrue British Pub experience ! You could feel the real atmosphere of tipycal british pub while enojoing good and genorous amount of food drinking good beer. Waitresses are really nice and kind. Reccomended to all visitors of London!,4
"AuthenticThis little authentic British pub is just a few blocks from the Imperial War Museum. If you are in the neighborhood definitely stop by for fish and chips. Food was yummy and well priced. The staff was friendly. I loved the local, neighborhood feel.",4
"Pretty good.Great fish and chips. Its located next to imperial war museum. Snooker table, and pretty good atmosphere.",4
"Brilliant Sunday roast dinnerIf you want a full traditional home cooked English Sunday Roast dinner then this is a good place to start.
It may not look much outside or in but the food could not be faulted nor could the really friendly staff.
The plate was packed full of perfectly cooked carrots, cauliflower, peas, parsnips, roast potatoes and creamy buttered mashed potatoes. Never mind the huge moist tender slices of roast beef good gravy & horseradish sauce and best of all- the best Yorkshire pudding I’ve had all but what my Grandmother used to make. All for the vast sum of £12!! You can’t go wrong and you won’t go home hungry either only regret was I was too full for sticky toffee pudding!",4
Great Service and good real ale & pub type foodEnjoyed everything this pub had to offer when we visited the Imperial War Museum. (Only a couple of minutes away). Reasonable prices for our Fish & chips and Scampi and Chips. A good choice of Sunday Roast was also on offer . Real ale well kept and from a decent brewery . Friendly service ( Thank you Caroline),4
"Fish & chipsThank you so much for your feedback,
We look forward to welcoming back again soon.
Kind regards
Tom",4
"Surprisingly good.Cosy little pub, very friendly service and good food. We went in with our family of 5 just before 7pm and got food and drinks pretty quickly. Chose this place as it was #23/18000 restaurants in London :'-) and close to our hotel !!

We got what we wanted i.e. traditional British pub culture with football on tv. Well worth the visit!",4
Nice pub. Good food. HospitalityI’ve had a lot of Sunday roasts and this was one of the best. The staff was very friendly. Decor wasn’t as nice as pubs in places like covent garden but the food and service were much better.,4
Great food!We went to the prince of Wales near E&C for dinner n the traditional pub food was delicious! We had the fish n chips as well as the steak n ale pie. Service was great and the restaurant was spacious with a large outdoor area.,5
"Good service, prices, and portionsMy family and I were staying nearby and wanted some food and beer. This place is perfect for both. The dinner was very reasonably priced and the portions were well sized, even for well sized Americans like ourselves. There were plenty of locals there, so you get the impression it's a legit London pub. Thanks to Caroline and others for the friendly service.",5
"good food and drink at the princewhat can one say about the prince! great staff good food and drinks . great place to be ,live music at weekends,",5
"Quick lunch stop on way back to stationWe came here after visiting the Imperial War Museum, wanting lunch, and picked here after seeing it on Google Maps and having a look at the menu which was placed outside.
After choosing a table and sitting down, we were immediately welcomed in by Laura, who gave us all a menu, and then a couple of minutes to make a drinks decision.
The drinks were served promptly, and our lunch order was made with no fuss - despite one member of our party having a few alterations to their order.

We had two of the gourmet burgers, plus a shepherd's pie - Laura kindly pointed out we could have cheese on the shepherd's pie, which was an offer quickly taken up!

We had a short wait for the food, which is more than fine, and were impressed when the food was served - the portion sizes were great, for the price paid, the food looked really good, and I was pleased to see that the side salad with the meals were also of a good size - and well-made, with a nice amount of dressing on each salad.

I was told that the burgers were extremely good, cooked well, but still nice and juicy. The shepherd's pie was excellent, with a large amount of cheese topping it (yay!) and the actual meat of the pie was nicely cooked, with just the right amount of seasoning - and extremely filling!

Most of all though, thank you to Laura for making us feel welcomed, we'll definitely visit again if we're in the area!",5
"Lively and lovely pub and very good foodThe pub is a lively place, bigger than we thought, including a large outdoors terrace as well. Looks very traditional and well taken care of from the outside and modern in the inside.

The woman who attended us, Laura, was lovely and served us quickly. The menu is short and pub-traditional but the quality of the food is outstanding. Everything was delicious and well presented and, if we were staying here for longer, we would repeat. 10/10!",5
"The Prince of WhalesGreat atmosphere, beer was great and so was the food! Would definitely recommend going for casual drinking and eating.",5
"Great place for lunch and/or a pintWe needed lunch after visiting the Imperial War Museum and found this cozy pub nearby. We had the Gourmet Burgers and they were the best burgers we've ever had in a pub. Excellent value for money! Also the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Perfect place to have lunch, dinner or beverages.",5
"Delicious and So Nice!Took my 5 year old here and we both had fish and chips (they have a kid’s menu). Caroline was awesome with my daughter, and the food was really good! Beer was delicious. It was family friendly, but you still felt you were in a pub. Will definitely will go back.",5
Accommodating and HospitableThe owners of this restaurant really made a group of 24 New Yorkers feel at home! We were so grateful for their hospitality and kindness. Food was excellent!,5
Great for the whole familyThe food has improved considerably- it is very reasonable and very tasty! Would definitely recommend!,5
ComplainI was in Zala grill aroud 7:30 on the 1.th June and i had a very bad customer service by Daniele who was serving us. He said he will going to serve us only if we gonna sit next to the place to drink a beer. We said we are with the bike so we are sitting 5m far from the restaurant. Than he said we HAVE TO sit here otherwise he is not goint to serve us. My friend said ok than we will do what he say. Than he said no you lieing!!!!! You will pay and walk away. May I ask how Daniele can say he is lieing? Which kind on customer service is this??? Also he didnt even give a pint of beer what was written on the receipt just 330ml but explained all of the beer is 5 pounds even if pint of Hella written on the receipt. When I asked for the book to complain he was saying he os the owner (which is not true because we know the owner) and there is no book which is obviously not true and gave back my money and extra beer to don't complain. Such a bad customer service. There are other place which sell better beer with better customer service! If I am the boss I won't keep this kind of people to work. There are other nice people who can do this job.,1
Food poisoningI went to this place yesterday for brunch and ordered the Jerusalem chicken 4-5 hrs later was sick. I didn’t eat anything else that day 😣,1
"Once a fab place but food quality has gone downI've been to this restaurant often. Visited late afternoon and told we could only have pitta. Disappointed and asked why I wasn't told at the time I made the reservation. Waitress then said, 'Hang on' and disappeared. She returned saying she'd managed to persuade the chef that we could have the menus. Thanks but isn't this a restaurant? My usual favourites were ordered along with a new dish, the steak as they didn't have my other favourite. The beef and lamb pitta used to be amazing; beautiful flatbread crisp on the outside and soft inside with a lovely flavour with succulent cuts of meat in a divine sauce just reminds me of a great holiday I spent once.

What arrived was a couple of grisly burgers on a plate with a side of the smallest pocketed pitta found in the cheapest supermarkets and a spoon of onion salad. I told the waitress it wasn't what I ordered and she said it was a mistake and she took it away and brought the steak. I wasn't even asked how I wished the steak to be be cooked and it was very thin and too well done for anyone's liking and therefore dry and chewy so I sent that back too only to get another still overcooked just sitting on a plate with a dollop of the same onion salad. Nothing home made about the chips and so little sumac all I could taste was the oil. The lamb and beef dish returned with an apology only to be the same burgers in the same pitta and by this time cold with a spoon of salad. I gave up, drank my wine, which incidentally was very good, paid and left. Such a shame as this used to be a gem! I'm only guessing it has changed hands.",2
"Quite niceLovely pizza - great fun to see it being cooked for us. One member of staff was rather brusque and passive aggressive, but the others were kind and friendly. Will be going back to try brunch.",3
"Heavy bread. Improved pizzaHi Charlotte, thanks for your review. I will speak to staff to ensure the usual excellent service is provided. As you can see from previous reviews we pride ourselves on excellent customer service. Glad the food was good at least.",3
"Great coffee, but a long wait for take-awayI'm a local and wanted to support local businesses but I found both the bread and pizza to be average and expensive. I tried the pizza when they first started to offer it but it was awful. Hard couldn't chew it. I tried the pizza again last night and it's a big improvement. Still expensive and not as nice as Franco manca but definitely better than it was before.

I tried the bread once when hubby came home with two. Not the amount we usually spend on bread for sure. They were very very heavy which is not very appealing to start with and was basically off by the following day so ended in the bin too.

So this place is not for us. Three stars is for the improved pizza nothing else I'm afraid.",3
"Food to Service imbalanceHello, thank you for your review! We make sourdough bread, which is slightly heavier than supermarket bread for sure! We grow our own yeast and each loaf is handmade and takes at least 12 hours to prove. You get a nuttier taste and rich crust. Labour, ingredients and the love that goes into it is quite a snip at £3 a 600 gram dough loaf I think you'll find. Supermarket, cheap and mass produced bread maybe to your liking so thanks for trying us out anyway.
You mention a competitor pizzeria that is a chain with economies of scale. We are often compared to this chain by the way, but the comments are quite the opposite re taste, quality of the base, freshness of the ingredients etc.
You tried! I hope you support other local businesses by the way.
Again, thanks for taking the time to write this and supporting this local business by comparing us to a chain!",3
"Too many seatsExcellent coffee, although still needs to improve service times when busy - almost ten minutes for a takeaway black coffee",3
"Lovely breakfastWhat a great find! We went on a Sunday and got there for opening at 8am. Good job we did because within half an hour people were queuing. Be warned the place is small and seating at a premium.

Lovely full English breakfast and the bread and butter was delicious. Loved having the toasters on the table, nice touch. Only downside is the already small table became even smaller with not much space for al the cups and plates.

The staff were lovely and really kind to my 5 year old son.

Quirky, fun and great food. Worth a visit.",4
"Quaint cafe, lovely bread and friendly staffThis was our first time here and we would love to visit again. One of us has many severe allergies and the staff were really helpful and accomodative of this. The breakfast was tasty. It is a small place and can be fairly squashed at the tables.",4
"Great brunchSmall place with 7 or 8 tables and was packed when we arrived, but managed to squeeze us in next to the window. Shortly after we arrived a queue quickly developed, so am glad we arrived when we did. Interesting menu with a some familiar items and a few more interesting brunch options. Our order did take around 15-20 minutes to arrive but was well worth the wait - the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon was very fresh and tasty. We also shared the American pancakes with berries, which also went down well. A steady stream of customers meant the place remained full and buzzing all the time we were there.",4
Very good breakfast placeHoly crap this place has big portions. I had a pork eggs benedict and I think I must have received a couple of pounds of pulled pork. We also had french toast and an almost comically large breakfast sandwich. All very tasty and worth trying. Very kind shop owner as well. Not 5 stars just because it wasn't one of my favorite meals ever.,4
Expect to queueI have been here a couple of times now and really enjoy the food and atmosphere but I do wish the place could accommodate more people as boy does it get frustrating having to wait for an age outside in the cold on a busy road. It does go to show though how popular this place is so they must be doing something right! The servers do always do their best though to get you in as soon as possible and have always been very friendly.,4
"Excellent coffee and foodThe coffee is great at Flour to the People and so is there service. As for the food, I've only had the muesli there and although it was delicious, I'm giving a very good rating because I found a wiry hair in my muesli and just thinking about it even now after a few weeks makes me gag. I don't think I can eat there again, which is such a shame because everything looks yummy. I didn't complain though because I had a friend with me and didn't want to spoil her breakfast.",4
"Battersea BreakfastThis is a small restaurant which serves really good breakfast. It gets exceptionally busy as it's a popular spot but it's worth the wait. There are plenty of breakfast options and they serve good coffee too. The staff are great, really friendly and make the experience even better.",4
"BreakfastNice toast, pancakes and egg Benedict ! The waiting time can be long to be seated and the restaurant can be packed ! Nice and agreeable staff. Lovely experience",4
Good localThank you so much for your review!,4
Shame it's so small!Place is a bit small but rather cosy. Staff always there to attend to your needs. Food was satisfactory. This part of town really needed some locals like this one.,4
"Best breakfast in SW LondonSpolied with superfresh homemade ingredients here!
Best breakfast i ever had in London. They are bread and sourdough is to die for.. Great find and resonably priced. Super generous portions. Coffee lovers paradise!!!definitely betten than high street chains.
Don’t forget to try the pancakes with homemade nutella sauce",5
"Best Brunch in lifeAmazing menu selection, ingredients are top quality and customer service is simply amazing, very friendly and kind staff. 5 stars all the way!",5
"Loved this place!! Gonna be a regular.This is one of my favourite spots in South! The service is such a friendly family run and relaxed vibe and makes you feel so comfy. Sitting in a bakery with an open kitchen, seeing the chefs and bakers do their thing is so lovely. There are so many quirky things in this spot, you feel like you are getting wholeome food and that people care about what they are cooking. The breakfasts and late brunch is perfect as its hard to find south of the river, and they are so open to changing things over if you are fussy like me. There is a toaster on each table and i dont know why its so fun to toast your own bread lol. I recommend it and they do the best coffees with every alternative milk option you can think of. The price isnt really cheap but its about what you would pay for a good brunch out, and the portions are generous. average for two with coffees & juice will be around £25 ish.",5
"Great sourdough pancakes!This very small restaurant was a wonderful find. The coffee was freshly brewed and the specialty of the house - sourdough - was on triumphant display. The pancakes were absolutely delicious and the sourdough toast was hearty and had a lovely crunch. Eggs were perfectly cooked. The atmosphere was pleasant and homey, though the place is very small and seating is limited and a mite snug.",5
"Best Avo on toast I’ve ever had!Popped in today and after spending a long time choosing from their extensive menu (I wanted one of everything!!) chose the ‘Avo and Egg Slam’. Generous portion, absolutely delicious, sourdough was very tasty too. Will be back to try more soon!",5
Worth a drive for weekend breakfastWhat a fantastic little find. If you are staying south of the river for a weekend then make the effort to visit here for breakfast. Their sourdough topped breakfasts and home made sourdough crumpets are to die for. Big portions are great value so make sure you are hungry. The coffee is some of the best I have had too all served with a smile. I may be from Northampton but I will be back for their sourdough pizza one evening for sure.,5
Excellent brunch and pizza - brillant serviceSuper local bakery whether for brunch or pizza. Food incredible and staff super charming. An absolute favourite!,5
"Best pizza in south LondonThis has now become our regular for pizzas - the best we have found in south London and we have tried a lot!!! Go and check it out, 100%",5
"Fantastic avocado on toast in BatterseaWent here for breakfast and ordered avocado on toast - comes with feta cheese and sweet chilli mixed in with it. Served on sourdough bread and in very generous portion sizes! Staff were friendly and welcoming, food arrived fast and was absolutely delicious. A great experience.",5
"Well worth the visit to Battersea ParkOur family of 5 truly enjoyed Flour to the People. From the way the menus are written, to the sumptuous and healthy (feeling-ish) homemade hazelnut-cocoa (do not call it Nutella) spread. We tried the Benedicts, the pulled pork slam, the smashed avocado with chili and the American one. Everything was delicious, including the
Homemade sourdough so light and crispy you’ll want to take some home with the leftover Nutella-ish. In addition to the great food, Hassan and the rest of the team will make you feel at home. If you are visiting London, a visit here will take you off the beaten path, but you will leave with a huge grin on your face. If you live in London what are you waiting for?",5
"Don’t go there!We went with friends who chose the restaurant. What a horrible place! It is dark, dingy and dirty. Looks like some 60s provincial eatery - dark wood, burgundy napkins (not too clean either), old fashioned plates etc.

Given a “smoked sherry” as an appetitive - one of the nastiest things I’ve had to drink.

Food was filthy - the vegetarian option was disgusting, sweet and sickly. My husband had the pork belly which was undercooked and tasteless.

I cannot understand the number of positive reviews this place has had. A most unpleasant experience.",1
"The worst dining experience I've ever had ...I've never felt the need to leave a review for any restaurants I've eaten at, even though I rely on reviews, but after the experience I had at Holy Smoke I have to speak out.

I've eaten in many restaurants in Wimbledon but had never heard of Holy Smoke so was intrigued by the fantastic reviews it had. I went with a friend for lunch.

Firstly I'll start with the positives, nice ambiance and service.

However the food was awful, I had wings to start with, they were bland and soggy. I then had the pulled pork with rice and homemade coleslaw. It looked like it had been plopped on the plate, again bland and boring.

I didn't enjoy either course, I don't think the chef seasoned either of the dishes. My friend didn't enjoy his food either.

The food was shockingly terrible which was a surprise after all the wonderful reviews that had been left.

It was the only time I've ever left a restaurant hungrier than when I went in!",1
Very averageWe were expecting big things of this restaurant given their high ranking on trip advisor but we're very disappointed. We got food poisoning after our visit. The price was also very expensive given what you got. The entree of scallops consisted of 1-2 scallops on a plate and the pork belly had no crackling (even though it says this on the menu). The wine was also poor quality. Overrated and won't be going back,1
"No way............. is this the top restaurant in London. And like others have said I was both disappointed and felt more than a little misled by the tripadvisor rating.
Yes there was a weird smell in the place, that really put me off, and I probably would have left given half a chance.
That said the food was actually ok- although I don't think I can return because the thought of the smell makes me feel more than a bit queezy!",1
"Holy disappointedOk I admit it, I gave in and followed the masses, after seeing it was rated number 1 in London(but didn't make the top 100 in time out) I had to visit.

The restaurant is situated in no mans land, between Wimbledon mainline and Wimbledon Park.

1st impressions were highly disappointing, it feels like a cross between and cheap Spanish brothel, and a brick lane bedsit, I'm lucky enough to have had the pleasure of both in the past. There was a strange smell as soon as we entered, the bearded waiter showed us to our table, no drinks or nibbles were offered.

After asking from some bread, I was served some dry faux focaccia.

We skipped starters and went straight to mains, much to the disappointment of the bearded waiter, he was ow starting to make me feel rather uncomfortable, so much so after picking up my napkin, and realising it was dirty, I felt too intimidated to raise my concerns, by now the smell and dirty napkin had me question of the cleanliness of the unseen parts of the restaurant.

After trying to order a coffee, only to be told they don't do proper coffee as they don't have a suitable machine.

We paid and left, inhaled the fresh air and thanked our lucky stars we Still could.

How this place made it to such a high ranking destroys any faith I had left in internet review sites.

Avoid at all costs and certainly don't make a trip across London expecting food to be of a standard worthy of the ranking.",1
"Not so holy smokeWe had been so looking forward to trying Holy Smoke after reading all the reviews and having recently moved to the area. It's hard to get in for an evening meal but we are around at lunch time and booked that - lunch is also extremely competitively priced at £12 for two courses and £15 for three. So we expected something simple...but tasty. My husband ordered the chicken livers which were ok but nothing special. My 25 year old daughter and I ordered the ""Slow roasted guinea-fowl wings, Bloody Mary sauce and blue cheese cream"". The wings were nicely roasted but poorly seasoned and it was hard to detect either the bloody or the blue in the fairly innocuous sauces. Where was the salt and pepper and some nice spicy flavouring - it had sounded like a lovely tasty dish! Following my husband had the ""Venison and pork meatballs, rich mushroom braise, celeriac mash, shredded carrot pickle"" which he thought was nice. We had the ""Warm nicoise salad with poached egg, french beans, new potatoes, cherry tomatoes black olives and anchovy"". What could go wrong we thought. But this too was a huge disappointment - lots of potato - thought they were good (but they made up two thirds of the salad), a few not particularly wonderful olives (that back of the mouth iron hit) a few nicely cooked beans and an overcooked (hard) poached egg and a few tomatoes lurking in the bottom of the bowl (we realised after we had left that they had forgotten the anchovies and that might have helped). The dressing was again fairly innocuous. Something mustardy would have enlivened such a dull salad - I hate to say it but I could have done a lot, lot better throwing this salad together for myself at home!

I didn't expect anything exotic for the price, but I did expect tasty and sadly now have no wish to go there for dinner in the evening or indeed to wander up to have lunch there again - the Italian a little further down the road seems more tempting.

What was good - the service was pleasant and friendly, the small free smoked sherry as a welcome - very welcome, and the wine we ordered delicious and not overpriced.

But two disappointing courses meant none of us wanted to try the deserts. It was such a disappointment when a restaurant is so well reviewed by others - maybe the chef was ill and not up to cooking, or someone else was standing in that day?",2
"Over-HypedI do not understand how this place is one of the best restaurants in Wimbledon. There is drab atmosphere and the portions are small. Of course, if you are one of the diner's looking for these ""upmarket"" experiences (expensive but small portions), you will probably enjoy it here. Service however, was very attentive and friendly.",2
"Tried hard but fundamentals all wrongWe read the reviews and were looking forward to this but left hugely underwhelmed.
- Atmosphere is dark and not especially welcoming. Worse: there was a strange smell which came from some of our napkins! One had clearly not been washed - it stank - so we had to exchange it. Before you think we're nightmare guests I should say that's the first time that's ever happened!
- Nice welcome on arrival but no bread, olives or anything like that. Seemed perplexed when we enquired about this. We only asked because the menu had been introduced with some words about ""quality over quantity"" which in retrospect seems sanctimonious - although certainly it's half true!
- Starter (smoked duck salad) was minute. Nothing special: some leaves, some wafer thin slivers of duck. Might have been smoked - equally could have been out of an M&S packet. A few blobs of mustard dressing and a few ultra thin slices of apple. Quite an achievement to put apple in a salad and engineer any crunch, bite or tang out of the dish - but they managed.
- Main (fish) was average. If the menu had said ""slightly soggy steamed cod"" instead of ""lapsang suchong and sake steamed cod"" it would have been more accurate. The cod fillet was a decent size but flavourless and watery. There were a few steamed greens with it which were similarly a bit soggy. The mushrooms were okay... but weirdly there were no potatoes or grain of any kind. The only side they do is chips. A couple of us were actually quite peckish so asked again for some bread and eventually they rustled up some passable focaccia.
- Dessert was better - the creme brulee was creamy with the brulee nice and thin and not burnt. The chocolate brownie was splendid and as an extra bonus is gluten free.
- All in all - way overpriced, way overhyped. Maybe the light lunch or burger is a better bet but definitely steer clear of the a la carte menu. You can do way better - in SW19 somewhere like Cote (to pick one) is reliably good, far better value, better location and a much nicer place to sit as well.",2
"do not believe the hypeAfter reading all the rave reviews, I was hugely disappointed by my first visit to this restaurant and do not understand how it can rank no 1 in London. Something has to be wrong with the rating system. I have eaten better in loads of Lonvdon restaurants including chains like Cote.

The restaurant is dark and dingy so not a good choice for a summer lunch. Whilst the service was good and obliging, the food was ok but not exceptional and a la carte was pricey. In hindsight the light lunch would have been a better choice. They offer a free liqueur but we would have preferred the option of some bread or some carbohydrates to accompany the main dish. The only choice offered was chips. After a three course meal I left feeling hungry.",2
"Not bad but not great eitherTucked away from the busy Wimbledon, here is the holy smoked. Very cosy with a lovely atmosphere but also quite confidential (only 6 covers that evening). Loved the sparkling wine by the glass but rather disappointed by my main (venison over cooked), presentation was lacking of flair. So the food was a average for me with better value quality/price around. Service was efficient but a little arrogant which did not bother me.",3
"Don't bank on itThis restaurant really needs to get its reservation system sorted out. My brother-in-law reserved a table for four for 17 April 2018 but when we arrived we were told they had no record of his booking. Fortunately, he had the email exchange on his mobile 'phone. After much humming and hawing they decided that they could fit us in. I reserved a table for three for 2 June 2018 but when we arrived we were directed to a table for two. When I pointed out that I had reserved for three there was much head scratching and despite the fact that they had the reservation for three on their system they said they were unable to accommodate us as the restaurant was fully booked. This was extremely disappointing as it was a Saturday night and finding an alternative at such short notice was not easy! We doubt very much that we will return.",3
TatstyThe food was ok. Wasn’t so rush spent couple of hours there. Had a nice time while I was there. Wasn’t busy so the service was quick,3
"Disappointing lunchDisappointing lunch menu, luke warm beetroot soup with bits of cartilage (gristle) from the pork ribs in it, then half a chicken on a plate with some lettuce leaves and tomato wedges. Good service, nice complimentary glass of smoked sherry, but lunch menu badly needs a makeover.",3
"Nice food average serviceThe food was absolutely stunning! The service was a bit luke warm, me and my girlfriend was here and wasn't treated as anything else than ""yet another customer"" but maybe they had a bad idea! Would go back just for the food!",3
Good but overratedMyself and a few friends went to this restaurant with great hopes. The food was decent but nothing spectacular for a top 20 restaurant in London. The alcohol selection was excellent with a good variety of gins and whiskey. The decor of the restaurant was plain and just needed a bit more. Maybe will try again but won't be rushing back,3
"Not as good as expected!Set menu three course lunch should have been good value. Tomato soup with ice cream was okay. Soup was just warm and I would have liked it hotter. Main course salmon and prawn fish cakes. Well they only tasted of potato. Very poor. Ice cream for dessert was very good. One of our party really liked his choice of three courses, his first and main were different from mine. We all had the lovely ice cream. Very creamy, yum! Restaurant too dark for lunch time. They do not sell fizzy drinks. They serve cordials. We had a most odd one, it didn't taste of anything. I wouldn't go back.",3
GoodThe place was nice we were there one afternoon for lunch good portions nice friendly staff would recommend to all however it's a bit pricey and the portions could be bigger,3
"GoodHire is good restaurant,but with high prices.The portion are too small and the personal is not active",3
"Promising restaurant but still some ways to goI visited this restaurant for a friend's birthday and it was about 40 of us. Lovely décor.
First course of cuttlefish was very nice, excellent combination of flavours, though a bit of a wait. This was followed by a another very lengthy wait for the main course which was overcooked and some actually burnt.

I think they could not quite cope with the number of people in bringing the food out for so many at the same time.

Nice selection of wines.

However, I am told that if you visit with few people that the service is much better.",3
"Really nice foodwe went for lunch , without booking in advance. the place is quite small, with 5-6 tables inside. the food it't really nice and there is a set menu to choose from (2 or 3 courses).however, no kids highchairs and the waiting time was a bit too long (considering we were with a toddler). so a good option, if you go out with friends or a date to have enough time to chat and enjoy food and drinks.",4
"Great value lunch menuHad the 3 courses for £15 and all the dishes were enjoyable. Starting with chicken livers, followed by pulled pork and finishing with New York style cheesecake. While the booking system is a little primitive, you have to email (they don't take phone calls) they did reply very promptly. Don't be put off by the website saying they are full (which seems odd) as when I arrived on Wednesday lunch I was the only person there. While it was good value I wouldn't go out my way to visit, its position in the top 10 on Tripadvisor is very flattering I would say. Nothing wrong with it but it didn't stand out. To finish on a positive they do give you a free sherry on arrival and rather bizarrely with your bill a full tube of mentos!",4
"Lovely little restaurantWe went for our 25th Wedding anniversary. We have never been to somewhere like Holy Smoke before and enjoyed it very much.
We booked by email as instructed and it was quick and easy. The restaurant was so dimly lit that we say in the car for a while thinking it was closed when we got there at 7pm
While darker than any other restaurant we'd ever been in it created a nice intimate atmosphere. There were tea lights on the tables. Our awesomely bearded waiter was I think also the owner or manager. He and the waitress we saw were lovely, and very helpful when I broke it to them how many things I was allergic to. They said in future to warn them a couple of days in advance and they'd take special precautions. I didn't die anyway ;-)
The menu wasn't huge but there was a good variety. My husband and son had venison and savoy cabbage which they enjoyed. I had the Thai spiced cod and sweet potato mash. For me the cod was slightly under done but I'm a food philistine.I think the whole dish was very sweet and mushy...the only texture being provided by some cashew nuts so I must admit I wasn't keen. I also thought it wasn't very hot. The white chocolate pud was very nice. My husband and son liked their creme brulees and then cheese board. Oh I didn't say....sweet smokey sherries were waiting for us on arrival and were gorgeous. We chose the cheapest red on the menu at 20 squid a bottle but it was delicious.
I liked the atmosphere, the drinks were terrific, the food nice but not amazing, portions slightly on he small side, people lovely. Best for an intimate dinner a deux.
Meal for 3 cost £156 with tip for 3 courses, cheeses for 2, 1 bottle of wine and a tip.",4
"Very good experience. Really worth a visit.We decided to give this a go on the basis of a recommendation and trip advisor. It is asmall little restaurant with a slightly old fashioned feel and ambience. That is not a criticism but it reminded us of the late 60 bistros in Chelsea but without the waxed bottle with a candle on the table. Very nice welcome with a glass of smoked sherry on the tabke., Small menu but decent choice and wine list fine. Very friendly and very competent service. Starters Beets salad very good and I had excellent scallops. Main courses an excellent venison and I had the cod with a thai sauce. They were both very good. Followed by an excellent duck egg creme brulee. It was very pleasant and slightly quirky. Name 'Holy Smoke' because given a chance he will smoke anything not just the sherry. You need to text or email to get a booking but dont be put off they do respond quite quickly. Definitley will go back soon.",4
"Amazing value at lunch timeWent at lunch time, its super hard to get in for dinner and really enjoyed it. Complimentary smoked sherry to start with and the guinea fowl wings for all of us followed by their smoked burger or pulled pork with rice and beans. Lovely service, unbelievable value although I was not blown away and suspect I will need to go back for dinner for the quintessential Holy Smoke experience.",4
"Excellent value, excellent service, a few tweaks would make it perfect!Holy Smoke was great on so many levels as a restaurant. An innovative concept based around smoked cooking, knowledgeable and welcoming service and excellent value are all huge plus points but the execution of the food in my view could definitely have been improved. £12 for the lunch menu for two courses is great value, and with a smoked sherry to start it could not be better. But the goat's cheese salad with pomegranate cream dressing and granola nuts was very dry and lacked quantity on the dressing which was a shame. Warm, crusted goat's cheese would have been nice too. The main of pulled pork with coleslaw and black bean risotto again was a delicious idea and the main part of the pork was cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the black beans and the rice in the risotto were under-cooked and not seasoned and there could have been more coleslaw, which, like the pork was also delicious. With coffee the bill was only £14.50 per head which was outstanding. I think I need to try Holy Smoke for dinner!",4
"Eccentric but goodI met a friend for lunch here. We were amazed that it has been going for over two years without us (both local residents) being aware of its existence. The name, it seems, comes from their specialisation in smoked and slow cooked food. We were immediately greeted with a complimentary glass of smoked sherry to make the point!

I like restaurants which offer food you'd never eat at home, and that was the case here. Slow steam roasted guinea fowl wings with blue cheese cream, tender moist and delicious, followed by sweet pulled pork, home made coleslaw with black bean risotto. A very good value California Pinot noir made for a delightful meal, at a very reasonable price.

Minor niggle - the lighting is very subdued, too much so for my taste. But I'll be back for sure.",4
"Great little place ... but just lacked the ""wow"" factor.On one of our 'London dates nite' and had to try this London top 10 restaurant as so local to us.
Restaurant is small and intimate ... but a little dark.
Service was excellent. ... very knowledgeable on the menu.
Slight lack of choice on the wine list and more choices needed by the glass.
Menu looked more at home for autumn/winter rather than a hot summers day.
My starter (cuttlefish) which was very nice but just lacked the bang/wow factor.
Better, but again lacked the wow was my main of partridge.
The wife had the veg option which had a little more going on than mine.
The white chocolate moosse for dessert was fantastic.
Finished off with some nice cheese but not a enough of them and would of prefered a greater range of tastes.

Overall price was very good for what we had.

For this London top 10 we probably judged a lot harder. ... it was a very good date night, just needs (for us) a little more polish.

Will we go back .... ""yeap"".",4
"Nice atmosphere and foodThe menu changes monthly and I advise to book ahead , 3 weeks ahead even it's small restaurant , about 7 tables

Every dish that came out was so flavourful and just lovely. I had sweet potato gnocchi and truffled mushrooms and that alone was such a different interpretation of typical gnocchi, others had pork belly and tasted so good. King prawns also v fresh

You'll enjoy it. We finished off the meal with some desserts which were again great accompanied with the holy smoke whiskey which I feel is a bit if a novelty , once that smoke is gone you'll get less than a shot of whiskey which seemed disappointing",4
"Charming restaurant, Great foodA small restaurant based in Wimbledon (small meaning its more intimate and staff are more attentive). Food is reasonably priced, well presented, unpretentious and most importantly delicious. My dining partner had the pork belly which I was informed had very delicate mixed of flavours, and sauces matched to perfection. I had the guinea fowl, which i thoroughly enjoyed. The restaurant is very good and we will return, it is however missing a little oomph factor...otherwise five stars.",4
Another excellent eveningDelicious food especially the lobster bisque as a starter and the rack of lamb which was a triumph Definitely my favourite go to restaurant,5
"Amazing food, amazing service. Thank you!Just been for dinner, what a great find, possibly some of the nicest food I’ve had, thanks again, will be back soon xx",5
"Birthday mealCannot praise this restaurant enough! Amazing food and brilliant staff, will definitely be returning! Did I mention the food was amazing!!",5
Throughly enjoyable neighborhood restaurantHad an all round great meal. Good wine and drinks if a bit gimmicky with the smoke aspect. The owner is friendly and knowledgeable about his offerings.,5
SUPERB!What a find. Lunched here on a quiet Tuesday but it didn't disappoint. Every mouthful burst with flavour. How could you not have three courses and so reasonably priced. If I had room I could quite happily have eaten it all again. How I wish I could produce flavours like this at home. Total enjoyment. Very happy. Will certainly return soon,5
"Great foodThe food is really delicious and they have a set menu to chose from (2 or 3 courses). The place is quite small, but cosy and friendly.",5
"Great little placeHad heard good things about this place and it didn't disappoint. Pretty much fine dining quality food without the pretense or price. Lobster bisque starter was a rich delight, scallops also excellent and perfectly cooked. Guinea Fowl was very tasty, and a generous sized portion. We shared a dessert - a limoncello mousse- which was nice but less impressive. The wine list is not extensive, but offers a decent enough selection. The atmosphere is cosy and service was generally good. A great place for quality food, good atmosphere at not ridiculous prices.",5
"Great!Amazing flavours, easy hospitality, superb wine. Small and cosy and very friendly. Salmon and venison as I've never tasted before. Great place for a first date, except maybe the art's a bit 70s, though that'll get the conversation started. The owner is a pro and a nice guy doing things just a bit differently and it works brilliantly. Great value too. Exceptional might be a better title come to think of it.....",5
"Food of loveThis is a small piece of food heaven. The founder is a true food lover, works tirelessly himself to ensure everything is perfect and each dish is clearly made with love and attention. With only a small number of covers each night it is a marvel that this place can survive at the prices charged. You will be hard pressed to find any place in London with better value for money than this.",5
"Great food, amazing value for lunchWe live close by and had heard great comments about Holy Smoke from friends and neighbours, so decided to try it. It's easy to miss the place, a plain black façade across from the dentist's and next door to the butchers'. Parking places across the road are few and only 1 hour max, so parked at Waitrose, as the restaurant website recommends, and from there it's a 2 minute walk.
We were the only table occupied of the 5-6 the place has, and they told us they are usually quiet for lunch time between Tuesday and Thursday, packed at other times. It's decorated simply, very clean, with good rock music on the background (at least that day!), but low volume allows a pleasant conversation. Greeted with a shot of smoked sherry, which we both found delicious.
Lunch is £12 for 2 courses or £15 for 3. For this quality of food, it's a steal. My wife had the onion soup, pulled pork & risotto and parfait, while I had the chicken livers, venison & pork meatballs and cheesecake. They were all very, very nice with good sized portions, all tasted fresh and does take a little while, which we actually found reassuring. We will definitely be back!",5
"Flabbergasted by the positive reviews, food was shockingly badI went with a colleague for lunch. The restaurant was empty but looked nice enough.
The menu seemed confused with a mixture of kebabs, Persian and Indian food. My expectations were low, to be honest, as we work in the area and no-one had ever suggested Iran as a good local restaurant to go to. The food was shockingly bad. Shockingly bad. Yes, the portions were big, but the food is bland, and the lamb fillet tasted off. Both our meals were served with a big dollop of rice and my ""salad"" was some stale leaves, half a sliced tomato and some sliced cucumber.

I don't mind if it's not authentic Persian cuisine. I just want the food to be tasty and that it was not. You couldn't pay me to go back. There are plenty of nice restaurants in Shepherd Market and the surround area. This is not one of them. I have no idea why this restaurant has so many other positive reviews. Service was ok otherwise.",1
"An ABSOLUTE disgrace to the Persian cusine!In all of my life I've NEVER had an experience like I had today at this restaurant. We called in and booked a table 5-6 hours before actually going. We specifically mentioned how many people we were and when we were arriving. But when we arrived we still were forced to wait. Then we finally get to the table, and a chair is missing, which resulted in another 15 minutes wait before we could all sit and have a look at the menus.
To our disadvantage our waiter wasn't familiar with Persian food, which of course wasn't helpful at all. On top of this the guy (short, short haired young guy with glasses) was really hostile and disrespectful to me and my family (I was there with my PARENTS!!). We had to ask the guy to bring over a bottle of water 7 times before we put our orders in, and the place was wasn't even busy at the time. When he brought out the cutlery I noticed that my spoon wasn't clean, and when I asked the waiter to bring me a clean one, he snatched the spoon out of my and and came back after 2 minutes and threw it on table while he walked by unfazed and unapologetic. After this horrible start you would at least think that the food must've been great because of all the good reviews but the food was an embarrassment to the Iranian kitchen. All of the 5 dishes we had, looked and tasted like they were made yesterday. Horrible service and so was the treatment they gave us.",1
"Very DisappointedWe were really looking forward to the experience and food, both of which was a real let down. We were sat downstairs and waited a long time for a menu or drink. Several people left due to the wait and in hindsight I wish we had. Too many tables so it felt uncomfortable and , sat next to the toilet the table was constantly being banged by the door as people went though. Constant sound of dish washing as well. The food, once it arrived was bland with the main course gate crashing the starters so we had to eat at their pace of delivery which after a long wait suddenly piled through like a tube train at rush hour. The final insult was the bill. Needless to say an experience I will never want to repeat.",1
poor quality foodWe came to Iran resturant for Iranian New Year late lunch. The food from starters to main course had such a poor quality that surprised us. Food was too old and too salty. Cannot recommend it to anyone as it's a bad representer to Iranian food.,1
"Everything below avarageAs an Iranian, I found everything specially food below average. They send me to the basement near toilet and there was a guy in kitchen making a lot of noises. The food was almost terrible and they charged me around 25 for almost nothing.",1
"Terrible food!!We were visiting from Sweden and I saw that this restaurant has 1700 something rewies and it looked like this place serves the absolute best Persian food in London but it was so disgusting. The kobide had tiny pieces of bones inside the minced meat. The barg tasted like it was broiled first then put on the grill. I can't find enough words to explain how bad the food was but stay away from here if you know how Persian food is supposed to taste cause it's hell not like this.

Can someone just explain how the hell they got so many rewies?? Do they pay people to do it or what??",1
"disgusting food for ridiculous pricesfirstly, the restaurant is a swear on the name of iran. the owner should change the name of the restaurant to 'robbery in daylight'. coz thats what it felt like when we went there. the food was so cold, and hard that we couldn't even chew it. the drinks were in disgusting glasses with stains on them. the space was so tiny. the owner was walking around as if he's achieved something. we were the only customers there. we were supposed to go to our favourite al hamrah, but we thought wed give this a try, being persian, we fancied some persian food. and everytime we eat in mayfair, we never have a thing to complain about.

however here, the atmosphere was so dull. the restaurant itself doesn't even have enough space for a person to move around in, i have no idea how they cope. the waiter was asking stupid questions about how to say certain things in farsi, which was so unprofessional.
the owner was talking so loud, to his friends over the counter, we could hear him from outside. the food was so bland and disgusting. small portions. it was around £60 per head, according to the food we ordered. and it was ghastly. it was the worse thing ever. we each had a spoon full and just looked at each other for minute.

next time i will stick to the famous al hamrah. bumping into my favourite celebs in there sometimes.

anyway we left our plates almost untouched and walked across to al hamrah which is right next door to this place.

OWNER IF YOU ARE READING, PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF AND LEARN ABOUT THE BUSINESS YOU ARE IN AND GET A CHEF WHO CAN COOK.

ALSO PLEASE CHANGE THE NAME OF YOUR RESTAURANT. its appealing to call a restaurant iran, when it doesn't even represent the food of iran properly.",1
Bad serviceVery bad service and was not upcoming on shortness of food. Did not explain until complained about the missing service and food.,1
"disporting restaurantnot sure why people rating this restaurant as one of the best persian restaurants in London, but I didn’t like the Kubideh. my wife ordered Ashe reshte however this was very bad quality.
They also forgot to ask what we wish to drink.
They forgot to bring Somagh.
the tables are located in the cellar which was very smelly, and very small!!!",1
"Good food but unbelievable service!The food is good but we had an extremely bad service! The old man who I think is the owner of the place was truly horrible! He let us set and after 15 minutes brought the menus then when we ordered they didn't serve the food for 20 minutes, they didn't bring all the food we ordered! They didn't bring bread even when we asked!
The same old man was checking on the other table next to us several times and completely ignored us!!
When we complained about the service in the end, he said just go and I don't want you in my place again!!!!!
It was very clear that he bases his service on race!!!
He is a very disgusting racist man and we are definitely not coming to this place never again!!!",1
"Crammed into a narrow alley in the red-light district with passing beggarsThe first impact on arrival was from an egyptian waiter trying to push past in the narrow alley with a pile of plates. Few of the waiters are Iranian. Nor is most of the food. So the waiters do not understand the menu and you must specify numbers for their benefit.

You sit on a sofa or chairs in an alleyway, with passers-by including beggars squeezing past the open side of the table. Occasionally waiters will also rush past. But it is nigh impossible to attract their attention, as some are on their mobile phones. You must shot loudly to get hold of them.

Food arrives randomly. One first course comes five minutes after the others. Second courses arrive before you have finished the first.

My Paneer Shabzi (an Indian dish) consisted of a large slice of feta cheese, acompanied by radishes with all the inedible leaves attached. It also had a big pile of leaves. The second course was a problem as several items were off. Eventually a lamb biryani (also Indian) arrived with a huge mound of rice, concealing a few nuggets of lamb. You would not go hungry, but these two dishes plus a green tea, where poor value at £30. To add insult to the mediocre offer, 12.5 % service was added.

The waiters hustled to clear the tables before we had finished a course and to remove the table-cloth before we were ready to leave. A two hour time limit is imposed, but we were well within this.

Noisy children and veiled muslim women at the very close next tables ( you cannot get out without disturbing those sitting on the table ends) did not make this an enjoyable experience. My friend had booked because of positive reviews. But I conclude that few of the diners know Asian food and are willing to accept pushy service.",2
Careful when you have to pay the billThe food was ok not the best Persian food I ever eat ... but was ok the service was fine and the place clean and nice decorated... I cud say very small place to many tables in a very small place ... the prices are high ...all was good and enjoyable until the moment that I have to pay ... as I am one of that person who check the bill to know for what I pay ... then I find out on the bill was added more things that I ordered and this ruin all the nice time that I had there ... then careful check the bill before you pay as is possible you will pay for more then you ordered,2
"Below par and overpriced.It started strangely when we turned up when we said we had a booking they didn't seem sure where to seat us. Then we were offered a table (which needed to be cleaned) sat outside with three of us perched on a sofa, and a chair tagged onto the end. One side of me was hot under the heater, and the other cold being out in the cold air! A bit odd, but nothing I / we can't live with.

There was a long time before we were seen again, and we then tried to order 4 cocktails (Whisky Sours - £6.50 on the menu) for which we were told cocktails were unavailable. Again, not the end of the world. Those who wanted their whisky fix got a Whiskey and Coke, which was fine too.

For starters 3 of us ordered between us a Baba Ganoush, Hummus, and a combination of lambs offal. It was all quite tasty, particularly the lambs offal, but we only had one naan bread to share between us for dipping, which was a bit stingy. At £6 each for a small plate (!), I would have definitely expected more - and more bread too.

The Lamb Shank Biryani I ordered was massive (..this is more like it!) ..but it tasted quite plain. It probably needed more marinating or a sauce or something. Also judging by one of the mixed grills on the table there was a fair bit of fat on the meat. He might have just been unlucky though as the other one was seemingly okay and got a favourable response.

We we got the bill and it seemed really expensive.. Then we realised the Whiskey and Cokes which we ordered were £12 each! Seems slightly unreasonable given that we ordered more elaborate cocktails for £6.50, which weren't available.

For a really small starter, and an acceptable but fairly bland main course, it just seemed very generally expensive for what we had. The drinks probably contributed a fair bit to that, but the quality was generally a bit disappointing overall, which was a bit of a shame given some of the high reviews given previously.",2
"Truly disappointingEven though we had a reservation they put us on a very tiny table at the back of a very noisy room, we could barely move. The food was okay but not spectacular, which explains the reasonable price considering it's location. What was truly atrocious was the wait. 45 minutes to even order and one hour for the food to arrive. Not only that but the waiter was rude and patronising. In the end, they didn't even bother make up the wait and our complaints in any way. If you expect the World famous Iranian hospitality, avoid this place. And If you expect excellent Persian food, London has countless better options.",2
"Used to be betterWent to the Iran Restaurant in Mayfair with my daughter and was a bit disappointed by both the food and the restaurant. Was there with my family a few years ago and remember it being much better.

The restaurant was very small and cramped and the furnishings were quite tired. Of the three sides that we had, only the babaganosh was tasty (the tomato and cucumber salad was soggy and the humos was dry and bland). The mixed grill with the beef, lamb and chicken also disappointed as the lamb was fatty and overcooked, the beef fatty and the chicken, while tender, lacking flavour whatsoever.

Perhaps I just visited on an off night, or perhaps my previous visit was a lucky one, but I don't think that I'll go again.",2
"Disappointing and UnappetisingThe online menu looks delicious and they advertise some nice mocktails. But when you get there you get a different less extensive menu. No mocktails for lunch. None of the desserts they advertise online except baklava. Food online looks beautiful. Food served is drab and unappetizing and tastes it too.

The chicken with walnut and pomegranate was a pile of rice with little saffron and a brown gravy sauce. I took two bites and couldn’t eat more. They felt bad so at least didn’t charge me and comped the coffee. My spouse had the mixed grill and it was very average. Hummus, dolmades and tabouleh really bland.

Owner arrogant but his waiters are spiffy and try hard.

The place is tiny. Four tables upstairs inside with room for very little food. And a few in a basement area near the cleaning room and toilets. The tables outside under an awning are nice and warm although a bit damp if it rains but they are the tables with space to sit and space for your food.

Really disappointing and can’t understand the great ratings.",2
"Understaffed, underwhelming.Expectations were high due to current ranking on tripadvisor. Waiters were really running but that wasn’t enough. Difficult to get attention. Beer selection (3 types) from horrible (budweiser) to bad (becks). Wine selection good but 37 GBP for a Malbec rated 3,2 on Vivino...
Starter (bread, humous etc.) really tasty but main courses (mainly grill) failed to impress.",2
"Car crashSo much went wrong ... crammed in to a table in the doorway. Failed to bring a) napkins, b) water, c) some of the ordered food, despite repeated requests. A box of tissues was offered when we pointed out we had no napkins, though some arrived eventually. Several of the dishes and drinks we wanted to order were unavailable, and then things arrived in a random order. One aubergine starter was very nice, as was the flatbread - but apart from that the food was really disappointing. Dry prawns, undressed salad, dry and unflavoursome rice. I'm not sure how they got the ratings here, I'm assuming the meat dishes (which we don't eat) must be absolutely stunning! Loos a nightmare with loose seats and then no running water - I it think they had some maintenance problems that evening but they kept taking in customers regardless. Staff harrassed and a bit clueless, constantly being berated by overbearing patron. On the plus side, when we started to point out (only some of) the problems we had, they tore up the bill - this is the redeeming feature that gives them two points rather than one. Went elsewhere for some pudding to take the taste away. I wouldn't go back.",2
"Maybe it was just a bad night ...But consider it carefully, I beseech you.
We travelled to get to it because of the rating here, selecting it over other places we've been to before and liked. It seemed lots of things went wrong.
I wanted to order melon juice but they only had (very nice) orange. Several of the starters were off, so the choice was limited. J had to have HALIM BADEMJON instead of baba ganoush (though it was the best thing we had). J was having a main, so I asked for soup to come with her starter, and other starters to come with her main. However a bowl of full madamas (field beans) came instead. J asked for olives, several times, but they never came. She had to ask for tap water several times. We only got napkins when we asked for them. I was told I'd get bread with my dishes but never got any.
J said there was chaos downstairs when she went to use the toilet and no water the 2nd time. Supply issues were blamed on the bank holiday the previous day and one waiter said the regular chef was off. The patron was angry with the waiters.
Maybe there was an unfortunate combination of circumstances but it still seems to us that the response should have been more organised, and customer service rather better in a highly rated place. It was a real letdown for us, though mitigated by the patron tearing up the bill.
It might have been better for meat eaters, or if the whole menu had been available. However none of the rest of the food was nice enough to make up for the problems, a bit crude and heavy, though the breads were good and fresh. Because the overall ratings were so good, I thought I could ignore the discordant notes but today I was wrong. I might give them another go because I've been challenged to, but with caution!",2
"Useless service, bad amenities and below average foodDon't believe the ratings! Bad service end to end - seated us on a rickety table, couldn't even be bothered to start us off with drinks / water, dropped the menu and disappeared, forced to order main course at 6 pm even before asking us for drinks, no advice on food whatsoever, didn't bother to tell us that dishes weren't available until after 10 minutes into ordering, to end it all - one average tasting baklava is all they had for pudding!

Not to mention the broken toilet seats - my kids literally fell off the toilet! Suffice to say - we are not going back!",2
"Hahard tasteless kebabs and chicken. Very disappointedAfter reading the reviews we looked forward to having a stellar meal but sadly the food was poor compared to colbeh, Yas and fairuz. The chicken Kababs were huge pieces of breast instead of small tender chunks and they were hard and tasteless and the koobideh was not soft and juicy or tasty. Can’t understand the high ratings.",3
"Good location food could be betterI visited this restaurant based on tripadvisor reviews. I’ve eaten at many Persian restaurants but found the food at this place a little too dry.

The little restaurant is quaint and lived that about it, with a few seats indoor and outside.

There were many restaurants nearby creating a lovely atmosphere on a nice summers evening in London.",3
"Moderately expensive OK foodReasonable food, but expected more given the price. Aubergine appetisers and baklava were tasty, but the lamb main courses felt tasteless and disappointing. Had better Persian food before.",3
Very disappointed!I had read great reviews and this place came highly recommended but it was a let down. Looks run down with worn out upholstery. Service was poor as only one server was there. Washroom was downstairs so one could glimpse the kitchen section which was dark and did not inspire any confidence. Washroom was not very clean. We ordered the lamb chops which were very oily and chewy. No flavour not even salt. The meatball skewer with them was a better. Saffron rice was not bad. After tasting one dish we were so disappointed that we did not want to order another one.,3
"Honest, but Mixed ReviewThis is a ""touristy"" restaurant in a ""touristy"" area. They are proud of their Tripadvisor rating and use that as a draw if you approach the reception desk, which is fair. I was there to dine with an Iranian friend and we ordered some appetizers and then the national dish: chelow kebab. The appetizers were great. But the chelow kebab (barg) was almost inedible. And here is where the restaurant lost credibility. I told the waiter (Mohammed) that I was not satisfied with the meal (and I've had this many times before at other establishments and, of course, my Iranian friend had also!), and he quickly changed the subject and left to attend to other matters. After finishing the meal, we tried to speak to the proprietor (Javad) to tell him of our poor experience , but were told he was unavailable. I can understand that many may have a positive experience at this restaurant which is reflected in their reviews, but regretfully ours was not. Moreover, the restaurant seemed uninterested in hearing feedback directly from us as we intended to provide - so I guess they will read it in this review.",3
"Excellent service .. average food!Average food and excellent service. The manger asked us to rate the restaurant excellent, that why the restaurant has high rate. here’s better Iranian restaurants in London.",3
"A very late Friday night dinnerThe place is OK and so is the food. I've definitely have had better.

The staff wasn't Iranian (not that it matters a lot but if you go to a real Japanese restaurant you expect the chef to be Japanese as well).

The tables are small and there decoration needs a upgrade especially when taking their location into account.

All in all not bad at all.",3
"Perfect location, average food and a rather grumpy owner/managerWe chose this restaurant for a family dinner mainly based on some real good reviews on this site. However, our experience was far from satisfactory. The restaurant was cold when we arrived, and when we raised this with the owner/manager, he sarcastically reminded us this was England, rather than ensuring that the door to the restaurant was kept closed as we had requested! We then asked him for some advice on the menu and what he would recommend. He mentioned that everything on the menu was fantastic and refused to even discuss this any further! We found him rather rule and condescending!

We did try a number of starters and main dishes and almost all were at best average! I guess this perhaps explains why he could not recommend any dish from the menu! Overall, we will never return to this restaurant. I would also suggest to all those who are looking for Persian food that there are many better restaurant choices in London. In central London for example, Kateh in Maida Vale, Galleria in Marylebone and Belgrave Persian Restaurant in St Johns Wood are far superior to this one.",3
"Not the bestI had very high hopes for this restaurant before going as I had heard a lot of good things about it. Coming from a Middle Eastern background I have had a lot of similar dishes throughout my life... and I must say the taste was very basic. When asked for sauces, chilli sauce/ garlic sauce ect which is a normal thing for such dishes... they said because it is a Saturday they have ran out of sauces completly. Wanted a cocktail but out of all days the cocktail making guy was off. I didnt want to be dissapointed but this is the case on this occasion.",3
"Great food in a friendly and simple restaurant.We chose this Persian having read the great reviews on TA. Arriving, we actually thought we'd ended up in the wrong Iran restaurant. It looked a bit like the dives you'll find when you travel off the beaten track - you know, the crowded family places with plastic awnings and flourecent tubes, which you can find in exotic countries and which usually serve excellent meals and cheap beer. Maybe we had the wrong expectations, maybe we expected an elegant, hushed, top class place. This looks like a tourist trap in Indonesia. The locale is extremely small - maybe four tables - and we actually had to walk sideways to get in and out. There is a cellar - more fluorecent tubes - windowless, with a wall-to-wall carpet and more tables, but I wouldn't like to sit there myself. There is outdoor seating and it's probably great to sit out there in Shepherd's market in the summer and gorge yourself with the wonderful food. Having had these initial trepidations, we were settled at a good table (the best of four) and had a wonderful meal. The waiter was very nice and we chatted about this and that, the wine was good, the starter of hummus and aubergine dip was also very good, together with maybe the most delicious flatbread we've ever had - freshly made in the special open fire oven. For mains, we had the same as everybody else - kebabs and rice. The skewered lamb was a little dry, as were the lamb chops, which we actually left. The chicken was also a little dry. Best of all were the mince kebabs, they were super scrumptious and we would have been happy eating only those, since there was a lot of food. All in all, a great place with friendly staff and delicious and generous portions. You'll be happy as long as you don't expect an elegant setting.",3
Great kebabs and great hostWent with friends and the food was very nice enjoyed it throughly. Tea and bakalwa was also very good,4
"Good FoodI picked this restaurant based on the large number of positive reviews it had. Overall, I have found almost all Persian restaurants in London to have good food and service. I see that some previous reviews complained of the outdoor set up of this restaurant. On this warm summer day, the outdoor seating was great. I found the combo of settee and armchair quiet comfortable. Fortunately, as another reviewer reported, we did not have any beggars go buy. Our server was not Iranian but he was familiar with the options. We were served within reasonable time and for some reason were kindly provided with an additional appetizer plate. All were delicious. Our food arrived shortly after the appetizers. Our koubideh, jujeh and ghormeh sabzi were tasty. We were greeted at the table by the owner who is passionate about providing good service. My only recommendation would be for a little more conviviality during service. I found the servers to be rather dry and somewhat disinterested.

"Very Good Iranian FoodThis is probably one of the best meals I had in the recent times. Very good Iranian food. Very small place but run by a family I think. Warm people. So troubled by other restaurants, nice ambience. Definitely recommend this.",4
"Nice restaurantMy family and I went to this restaurant on Sunday,we have tried many dishes.
Baba goulash and hummus was very good ( if you don't like the garlic please choose another thing). After that mixed grill and lamb skewers with saffron rice. The meat was very tender and tasty.
Good wine list and awesome dessert ( ""baklava""). The price is little bit higher even if you should consider the area where the restaurant is located. Would go there again.",4
"A great find tucked away in the Centre of LondonCalled in early evening as we were staying in a nearby hotel. Really like Persian cuisine and Iran did not disappoint. Couldn't decide whether to sit outside or in, and were shown to a table inside but by the open window. Brilliant table to enjoy both the food and the People watching. The service was friendly, efficient and not overly intrusive. However, the food was the real deal. Had kebab and saffron rice, which were excellent and the starters just as good. Reasonably priced for the area but check the bill as 12.5% service charge is added and you may wish to show your appreciation in other ways.
Otherwise we're really glkad we came and will call again next we're in town.",4
Very good dinner and would go againI sought this restaurant out because I love Iranian food and it did not disappoint. Everything was fresh and delicious (I watched the bread being made) and I was permitted to substitute a different rice dish with my main course without an upcharge. There was complementary mezze and although I dined alone I was not rushed and the service was attentive. This was one of the better meals I had in London.,4
"Amazing food, good location not so good interiorWent for lunch, I loved the food I ordered here and tasted amazing. The server we had was also very polite and helpful
We got a complimentry soup to start I’m not sure what it was but it’s tasted off and bad, other than that the food we had was amazing. This place is in may fair but the design and seating of this place is terrible designed. I’m tiny not sure how a tall person would walk around this restaurant or even stand comfortably, the toilets were not great door would not lock for the ladies. There is not a comfortable plc to sit here.
I really wanted to give this restaurant 5*, but the interior and restaurant set up ruined it for me",4
"Great food, wobbly serviceThe food here was absolutely excellent and definitely merits a visit-- the warm dolmeh were amazing as was the chicken kebab. However the service was strange, with mixed up orders, wrong drinks delivered, and confusion on the waiter's part about what we had ordered and what the kitchen was out of. Still, worth it for the quality!",4
"Cozy and nice, in the heart of MyfairA small but confortable restaurant, where you will find the tipical lebanese-arabian specialties: hummus, lentil soup, ot bread, and then meat, chicken or fish, fresh and well prepared. Wine and beers, as a western dinner requires. Prices are cheap for the zone and service is more than gentle.",4
"Fantastic quality of food | , я русскаяI’ve tried Iranian food before but this is the best I’ve ever had. The service was great and the food lovely. Very high quality food and robust portions. Highly recommended!",4
"OutstandingJust had dinner with friends at Iran restaurant, I just had to leave a review. The owner was very nice, and the food was the best food I’ve had in a long time, I had the mixed grill the chicken was so tender and soft the chops were amazing and the rice was out of this world I normally leave the rice but I had to finish it. I would 100% recommend going to this restaurant.",5
"Excellent service and foodFirst and foremost, my friends and I were served by a smiling waiter named Jamshid. It was their first time to have Iranian cuisine and they were so impressed. Jamshid was knowledgeable and kind, with warm eyes and an inviting smile. The environment of the restaurant is intimate and cozy, which gave us an instant feeling of comfort. The diners were international, of all ages, and everyone around us seemed to enjoy themselves just as much as we did. As for the food, great! The gems of the dinner were the dolmeh (stuffed vine leaves), which were some of the best I have ever had, the chicken tachine was mouth-watering and the baklawa and mint tea were just what we needed to finish our meal. Excellent choice! Thanks Jamshid for your hospitality and recommendations!",5
Hidden Gem!Great food and authentic experience. We caught up with a friend and found this lovely restaurant. Great atmosphere and nice menu. Fantastic service. Kubede was delicious!,5
Great restaurant and friendly staff!Came here with a friend based on a recommendation from another and friend and we had an amazing time! The food was absolutely delicious (special thanks to the chef!!). Definitely recommend and I’m sure I’ll be back here soon :),5
"Food recommendationThe food is very delicious, one of the best restaurants in london. I advise people to try it. Im from UAE , the food tastes so nice similar to irani restaurants in our country.",5
"Wonderful Dining Experience from A-Z!We were welcomed warmly and seated at a table on the street which was more of a lane between a number of restaurants and hookah bars. Perfect atmosphere for our meal of nan bread, our appetizers of dolmas, a spinach yogurt, and the number 14 (can’t remember the name) which was a rich and savory dish of diced eggplant, onions and egg. Even though we didn’t order the 14, the waiter wanted us to try it and brought it on spec. It was so good we got a second round of that with a dinner of tachine chicken and mixed grill with chicken, lamb, and marinated lamb. All of the meet was cooked to perfection and accompanied by the delicious saffron rice and a salad. When we asked for the check, they brought us tea and baklava on the house. Even though we started this trip in Paris for 5 nights, this was the best meal of our trip so far!",5
Very good Iranian restaurant!Very good Iranian restaurant. The host and staff very friendly. Highly recommended if you are looking for Iranian cousine in London.,5
"Great Persian Food With A Nice Mayfair AmbianceI came here with a group of friends for dinner, the service was good the food presentation and portions was great and the taste was fantastic! Definitely coming here again.",5
Fantastic foodWe were looking for somewhere authentic to eat and found it here. Absolutely beautiful food and great service. We were made to feel very welcome and really enjoyed eating here.,5
"The most amazing food in the area.We were looking for a good dinner. Instead we came upon this fantastic place. It has amazing food, great service, and the owner makes you feel like you are at home, by stopping by inquiring about the food, bringing dishes, and making sure our experience has been nothing short but the best. If your in the area, make sure to stop by, you won’t be sorry!",5
"Flabbergasted by the positive reviews, food was shockingly badI went with a colleague for lunch. The restaurant was empty but looked nice enough.
The menu seemed confused with a mixture of kebabs, Persian and Indian food. My expectations were low, to be honest, as we work in the area and no-one had ever suggested Iran as a good local restaurant to go to. The food was shockingly bad. Shockingly bad. Yes, the portions were big, but the food is bland, and the lamb fillet tasted off. Both our meals were served with a big dollop of rice and my ""salad"" was some stale leaves, half a sliced tomato and some sliced cucumber.

I don't mind if it's not authentic Persian cuisine. I just want the food to be tasty and that it was not. You couldn't pay me to go back. There are plenty of nice restaurants in Shepherd Market and the surround area. This is not one of them. I have no idea why this restaurant has so many other positive reviews. Service was ok otherwise.",1
"An ABSOLUTE disgrace to the Persian cusine!In all of my life I've NEVER had an experience like I had today at this restaurant. We called in and booked a table 5-6 hours before actually going. We specifically mentioned how many people we were and when we were arriving. But when we arrived we still were forced to wait. Then we finally get to the table, and a chair is missing, which resulted in another 15 minutes wait before we could all sit and have a look at the menus.
To our disadvantage our waiter wasn't familiar with Persian food, which of course wasn't helpful at all. On top of this the guy (short, short haired young guy with glasses) was really hostile and disrespectful to me and my family (I was there with my PARENTS!!). We had to ask the guy to bring over a bottle of water 7 times before we put our orders in, and the place was wasn't even busy at the time. When he brought out the cutlery I noticed that my spoon wasn't clean, and when I asked the waiter to bring me a clean one, he snatched the spoon out of my and and came back after 2 minutes and threw it on table while he walked by unfazed and unapologetic. After this horrible start you would at least think that the food must've been great because of all the good reviews but the food was an embarrassment to the Iranian kitchen. All of the 5 dishes we had, looked and tasted like they were made yesterday. Horrible service and so was the treatment they gave us.",1
"Very DisappointedWe were really looking forward to the experience and food, both of which was a real let down. We were sat downstairs and waited a long time for a menu or drink. Several people left due to the wait and in hindsight I wish we had. Too many tables so it felt uncomfortable and , sat next to the toilet the table was constantly being banged by the door as people went though. Constant sound of dish washing as well. The food, once it arrived was bland with the main course gate crashing the starters so we had to eat at their pace of delivery which after a long wait suddenly piled through like a tube train at rush hour. The final insult was the bill. Needless to say an experience I will never want to repeat.",1
poor quality foodWe came to Iran resturant for Iranian New Year late lunch. The food from starters to main course had such a poor quality that surprised us. Food was too old and too salty. Cannot recommend it to anyone as it's a bad representer to Iranian food.,1
"Everything below avarageAs an Iranian, I found everything specially food below average. They send me to the basement near toilet and there was a guy in kitchen making a lot of noises. The food was almost terrible and they charged me around 25 for almost nothing.",1
"Terrible food!!We were visiting from Sweden and I saw that this restaurant has 1700 something rewies and it looked like this place serves the absolute best Persian food in London but it was so disgusting. The kobide had tiny pieces of bones inside the minced meat. The barg tasted like it was broiled first then put on the grill. I can't find enough words to explain how bad the food was but stay away from here if you know how Persian food is supposed to taste cause it's hell not like this.

Can someone just explain how the hell they got so many rewies?? Do they pay people to do it or what??",1
"disgusting food for ridiculous pricesfirstly, the restaurant is a swear on the name of iran. the owner should change the name of the restaurant to 'robbery in daylight'. coz thats what it felt like when we went there. the food was so cold, and hard that we couldn't even chew it. the drinks were in disgusting glasses with stains on them. the space was so tiny. the owner was walking around as if he's achieved something. we were the only customers there. we were supposed to go to our favourite al hamrah, but we thought wed give this a try, being persian, we fancied some persian food. and everytime we eat in mayfair, we never have a thing to complain about.

however here, the atmosphere was so dull. the restaurant itself doesn't even have enough space for a person to move around in, i have no idea how they cope. the waiter was asking stupid questions about how to say certain things in farsi, which was so unprofessional.
the owner was talking so loud, to his friends over the counter, we could hear him from outside. the food was so bland and disgusting. small portions. it was around £60 per head, according to the food we ordered. and it was ghastly. it was the worse thing ever. we each had a spoon full and just looked at each other for minute.

next time i will stick to the famous al hamrah. bumping into my favourite celebs in there sometimes.

anyway we left our plates almost untouched and walked across to al hamrah which is right next door to this place.

OWNER IF YOU ARE READING, PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF AND LEARN ABOUT THE BUSINESS YOU ARE IN AND GET A CHEF WHO CAN COOK.

ALSO PLEASE CHANGE THE NAME OF YOUR RESTAURANT. its appealing to call a restaurant iran, when it doesn't even represent the food of iran properly.",1
Bad serviceVery bad service and was not upcoming on shortness of food. Did not explain until complained about the missing service and food.,1
"disporting restaurantnot sure why people rating this restaurant as one of the best persian restaurants in London, but I didn’t like the Kubideh. my wife ordered Ashe reshte however this was very bad quality.
They also forgot to ask what we wish to drink.
They forgot to bring Somagh.
the tables are located in the cellar which was very smelly, and very small!!!",1
"Good food but unbelievable service!The food is good but we had an extremely bad service! The old man who I think is the owner of the place was truly horrible! He let us set and after 15 minutes brought the menus then when we ordered they didn't serve the food for 20 minutes, they didn't bring all the food we ordered! They didn't bring bread even when we asked!
The same old man was checking on the other table next to us several times and completely ignored us!!
When we complained about the service in the end, he said just go and I don't want you in my place again!!!!!
It was very clear that he bases his service on race!!!
He is a very disgusting racist man and we are definitely not coming to this place never again!!!",1
"Crammed into a narrow alley in the red-light district with passing beggarsThe first impact on arrival was from an egyptian waiter trying to push past in the narrow alley with a pile of plates. Few of the waiters are Iranian. Nor is most of the food. So the waiters do not understand the menu and you must specify numbers for their benefit.

You sit on a sofa or chairs in an alleyway, with passers-by including beggars squeezing past the open side of the table. Occasionally waiters will also rush past. But it is nigh impossible to attract their attention, as some are on their mobile phones. You must shot loudly to get hold of them.

Food arrives randomly. One first course comes five minutes after the others. Second courses arrive before you have finished the first.

My Paneer Shabzi (an Indian dish) consisted of a large slice of feta cheese, acompanied by radishes with all the inedible leaves attached. It also had a big pile of leaves. The second course was a problem as several items were off. Eventually a lamb biryani (also Indian) arrived with a huge mound of rice, concealing a few nuggets of lamb. You would not go hungry, but these two dishes plus a green tea, where poor value at £30. To add insult to the mediocre offer, 12.5 % service was added.

The waiters hustled to clear the tables before we had finished a course and to remove the table-cloth before we were ready to leave. A two hour time limit is imposed, but we were well within this.

Noisy children and veiled muslim women at the very close next tables ( you cannot get out without disturbing those sitting on the table ends) did not make this an enjoyable experience. My friend had booked because of positive reviews. But I conclude that few of the diners know Asian food and are willing to accept pushy service.",2
Careful when you have to pay the billThe food was ok not the best Persian food I ever eat ... but was ok the service was fine and the place clean and nice decorated... I cud say very small place to many tables in a very small place ... the prices are high ...all was good and enjoyable until the moment that I have to pay ... as I am one of that person who check the bill to know for what I pay ... then I find out on the bill was added more things that I ordered and this ruin all the nice time that I had there ... then careful check the bill before you pay as is possible you will pay for more then you ordered,2
"Below par and overpriced.It started strangely when we turned up when we said we had a booking they didn't seem sure where to seat us. Then we were offered a table (which needed to be cleaned) sat outside with three of us perched on a sofa, and a chair tagged onto the end. One side of me was hot under the heater, and the other cold being out in the cold air! A bit odd, but nothing I / we can't live with.

There was a long time before we were seen again, and we then tried to order 4 cocktails (Whisky Sours - £6.50 on the menu) for which we were told cocktails were unavailable. Again, not the end of the world. Those who wanted their whisky fix got a Whiskey and Coke, which was fine too.

For starters 3 of us ordered between us a Baba Ganoush, Hummus, and a combination of lambs offal. It was all quite tasty, particularly the lambs offal, but we only had one naan bread to share between us for dipping, which was a bit stingy. At £6 each for a small plate (!), I would have definitely expected more - and more bread too.

The Lamb Shank Biryani I ordered was massive (..this is more like it!) ..but it tasted quite plain. It probably needed more marinating or a sauce or something. Also judging by one of the mixed grills on the table there was a fair bit of fat on the meat. He might have just been unlucky though as the other one was seemingly okay and got a favourable response.

We we got the bill and it seemed really expensive.. Then we realised the Whiskey and Cokes which we ordered were £12 each! Seems slightly unreasonable given that we ordered more elaborate cocktails for £6.50, which weren't available.

For a really small starter, and an acceptable but fairly bland main course, it just seemed very generally expensive for what we had. The drinks probably contributed a fair bit to that, but the quality was generally a bit disappointing overall, which was a bit of a shame given some of the high reviews given previously.",2
"Truly disappointingEven though we had a reservation they put us on a very tiny table at the back of a very noisy room, we could barely move. The food was okay but not spectacular, which explains the reasonable price considering it's location. What was truly atrocious was the wait. 45 minutes to even order and one hour for the food to arrive. Not only that but the waiter was rude and patronising. In the end, they didn't even bother make up the wait and our complaints in any way. If you expect the World famous Iranian hospitality, avoid this place. And If you expect excellent Persian food, London has countless better options.",2
"Used to be betterWent to the Iran Restaurant in Mayfair with my daughter and was a bit disappointed by both the food and the restaurant. Was there with my family a few years ago and remember it being much better.

The restaurant was very small and cramped and the furnishings were quite tired. Of the three sides that we had, only the babaganosh was tasty (the tomato and cucumber salad was soggy and the humos was dry and bland). The mixed grill with the beef, lamb and chicken also disappointed as the lamb was fatty and overcooked, the beef fatty and the chicken, while tender, lacking flavour whatsoever.

Perhaps I just visited on an off night, or perhaps my previous visit was a lucky one, but I don't think that I'll go again.",2
"Disappointing and UnappetisingThe online menu looks delicious and they advertise some nice mocktails. But when you get there you get a different less extensive menu. No mocktails for lunch. None of the desserts they advertise online except baklava. Food online looks beautiful. Food served is drab and unappetizing and tastes it too.

The chicken with walnut and pomegranate was a pile of rice with little saffron and a brown gravy sauce. I took two bites and couldn’t eat more. They felt bad so at least didn’t charge me and comped the coffee. My spouse had the mixed grill and it was very average. Hummus, dolmades and tabouleh really bland.

Owner arrogant but his waiters are spiffy and try hard.

The place is tiny. Four tables upstairs inside with room for very little food. And a few in a basement area near the cleaning room and toilets. The tables outside under an awning are nice and warm although a bit damp if it rains but they are the tables with space to sit and space for your food.

Really disappointing and can’t understand the great ratings.",2
"Understaffed, underwhelming.Expectations were high due to current ranking on tripadvisor. Waiters were really running but that wasn’t enough. Difficult to get attention. Beer selection (3 types) from horrible (budweiser) to bad (becks). Wine selection good but 37 GBP for a Malbec rated 3,2 on Vivino...
Starter (bread, humous etc.) really tasty but main courses (mainly grill) failed to impress.",2
"Car crashSo much went wrong ... crammed in to a table in the doorway. Failed to bring a) napkins, b) water, c) some of the ordered food, despite repeated requests. A box of tissues was offered when we pointed out we had no napkins, though some arrived eventually. Several of the dishes and drinks we wanted to order were unavailable, and then things arrived in a random order. One aubergine starter was very nice, as was the flatbread - but apart from that the food was really disappointing. Dry prawns, undressed salad, dry and unflavoursome rice. I'm not sure how they got the ratings here, I'm assuming the meat dishes (which we don't eat) must be absolutely stunning! Loos a nightmare with loose seats and then no running water - I it think they had some maintenance problems that evening but they kept taking in customers regardless. Staff harrassed and a bit clueless, constantly being berated by overbearing patron. On the plus side, when we started to point out (only some of) the problems we had, they tore up the bill - this is the redeeming feature that gives them two points rather than one. Went elsewhere for some pudding to take the taste away. I wouldn't go back.",2
"Maybe it was just a bad night ...But consider it carefully, I beseech you.
We travelled to get to it because of the rating here, selecting it over other places we've been to before and liked. It seemed lots of things went wrong.
I wanted to order melon juice but they only had (very nice) orange. Several of the starters were off, so the choice was limited. J had to have HALIM BADEMJON instead of baba ganoush (though it was the best thing we had). J was having a main, so I asked for soup to come with her starter, and other starters to come with her main. However a bowl of full madamas (field beans) came instead. J asked for olives, several times, but they never came. She had to ask for tap water several times. We only got napkins when we asked for them. I was told I'd get bread with my dishes but never got any.
J said there was chaos downstairs when she went to use the toilet and no water the 2nd time. Supply issues were blamed on the bank holiday the previous day and one waiter said the regular chef was off. The patron was angry with the waiters.
Maybe there was an unfortunate combination of circumstances but it still seems to us that the response should have been more organised, and customer service rather better in a highly rated place. It was a real letdown for us, though mitigated by the patron tearing up the bill.
It might have been better for meat eaters, or if the whole menu had been available. However none of the rest of the food was nice enough to make up for the problems, a bit crude and heavy, though the breads were good and fresh. Because the overall ratings were so good, I thought I could ignore the discordant notes but today I was wrong. I might give them another go because I've been challenged to, but with caution!",2
"Useless service, bad amenities and below average foodDon't believe the ratings! Bad service end to end - seated us on a rickety table, couldn't even be bothered to start us off with drinks / water, dropped the menu and disappeared, forced to order main course at 6 pm even before asking us for drinks, no advice on food whatsoever, didn't bother to tell us that dishes weren't available until after 10 minutes into ordering, to end it all - one average tasting baklava is all they had for pudding!

Not to mention the broken toilet seats - my kids literally fell off the toilet! Suffice to say - we are not going back!",2
"Hahard tasteless kebabs and chicken. Very disappointedAfter reading the reviews we looked forward to having a stellar meal but sadly the food was poor compared to colbeh, Yas and fairuz. The chicken Kababs were huge pieces of breast instead of small tender chunks and they were hard and tasteless and the koobideh was not soft and juicy or tasty. Can’t understand the high ratings.",3
"Good location food could be betterI visited this restaurant based on tripadvisor reviews. I’ve eaten at many Persian restaurants but found the food at this place a little too dry.

The little restaurant is quaint and lived that about it, with a few seats indoor and outside.

There were many restaurants nearby creating a lovely atmosphere on a nice summers evening in London.",3
"Moderately expensive OK foodReasonable food, but expected more given the price. Aubergine appetisers and baklava were tasty, but the lamb main courses felt tasteless and disappointing. Had better Persian food before.",3
Very disappointed!I had read great reviews and this place came highly recommended but it was a let down. Looks run down with worn out upholstery. Service was poor as only one server was there. Washroom was downstairs so one could glimpse the kitchen section which was dark and did not inspire any confidence. Washroom was not very clean. We ordered the lamb chops which were very oily and chewy. No flavour not even salt. The meatball skewer with them was a better. Saffron rice was not bad. After tasting one dish we were so disappointed that we did not want to order another one.,3
"Honest, but Mixed ReviewThis is a ""touristy"" restaurant in a ""touristy"" area. They are proud of their Tripadvisor rating and use that as a draw if you approach the reception desk, which is fair. I was there to dine with an Iranian friend and we ordered some appetizers and then the national dish: chelow kebab. The appetizers were great. But the chelow kebab (barg) was almost inedible. And here is where the restaurant lost credibility. I told the waiter (Mohammed) that I was not satisfied with the meal (and I've had this many times before at other establishments and, of course, my Iranian friend had also!), and he quickly changed the subject and left to attend to other matters. After finishing the meal, we tried to speak to the proprietor (Javad) to tell him of our poor experience , but were told he was unavailable. I can understand that many may have a positive experience at this restaurant which is reflected in their reviews, but regretfully ours was not. Moreover, the restaurant seemed uninterested in hearing feedback directly from us as we intended to provide - so I guess they will read it in this review.",3
"Excellent service .. average food!Average food and excellent service. The manger asked us to rate the restaurant excellent, that why the restaurant has high rate. here’s better Iranian restaurants in London.",3
"A very late Friday night dinnerThe place is OK and so is the food. I've definitely have had better.

The staff wasn't Iranian (not that it matters a lot but if you go to a real Japanese restaurant you expect the chef to be Japanese as well).

The tables are small and there decoration needs a upgrade especially when taking their location into account.

All in all not bad at all.",3
"Perfect location, average food and a rather grumpy owner/managerWe chose this restaurant for a family dinner mainly based on some real good reviews on this site. However, our experience was far from satisfactory. The restaurant was cold when we arrived, and when we raised this with the owner/manager, he sarcastically reminded us this was England, rather than ensuring that the door to the restaurant was kept closed as we had requested! We then asked him for some advice on the menu and what he would recommend. He mentioned that everything on the menu was fantastic and refused to even discuss this any further! We found him rather rule and condescending!

We did try a number of starters and main dishes and almost all were at best average! I guess this perhaps explains why he could not recommend any dish from the menu! Overall, we will never return to this restaurant. I would also suggest to all those who are looking for Persian food that there are many better restaurant choices in London. In central London for example, Kateh in Maida Vale, Galleria in Marylebone and Belgrave Persian Restaurant in St Johns Wood are far superior to this one.",3
"Not the bestI had very high hopes for this restaurant before going as I had heard a lot of good things about it. Coming from a Middle Eastern background I have had a lot of similar dishes throughout my life... and I must say the taste was very basic. When asked for sauces, chilli sauce/ garlic sauce ect which is a normal thing for such dishes... they said because it is a Saturday they have ran out of sauces completly. Wanted a cocktail but out of all days the cocktail making guy was off. I didnt want to be dissapointed but this is the case on this occasion.",3
"Great food in a friendly and simple restaurant.We chose this Persian having read the great reviews on TA. Arriving, we actually thought we'd ended up in the wrong Iran restaurant. It looked a bit like the dives you'll find when you travel off the beaten track - you know, the crowded family places with plastic awnings and flourecent tubes, which you can find in exotic countries and which usually serve excellent meals and cheap beer. Maybe we had the wrong expectations, maybe we expected an elegant, hushed, top class place. This looks like a tourist trap in Indonesia. The locale is extremely small - maybe four tables - and we actually had to walk sideways to get in and out. There is a cellar - more fluorecent tubes - windowless, with a wall-to-wall carpet and more tables, but I wouldn't like to sit there myself. There is outdoor seating and it's probably great to sit out there in Shepherd's market in the summer and gorge yourself with the wonderful food. Having had these initial trepidations, we were settled at a good table (the best of four) and had a wonderful meal. The waiter was very nice and we chatted about this and that, the wine was good, the starter of hummus and aubergine dip was also very good, together with maybe the most delicious flatbread we've ever had - freshly made in the special open fire oven. For mains, we had the same as everybody else - kebabs and rice. The skewered lamb was a little dry, as were the lamb chops, which we actually left. The chicken was also a little dry. Best of all were the mince kebabs, they were super scrumptious and we would have been happy eating only those, since there was a lot of food. All in all, a great place with friendly staff and delicious and generous portions. You'll be happy as long as you don't expect an elegant setting.",3
Great kebabs and great hostWent with friends and the food was very nice enjoyed it throughly. Tea and bakalwa was also very good,4

Very good dinner and would go againI sought this restaurant out because I love Iranian food and it did not disappoint. Everything was fresh and delicious (I watched the bread being made) and I was permitted to substitute a different rice dish with my main course without an upcharge. There was complementary mezze and although I dined alone I was not rushed and the service was attentive. This was one of the better meals I had in London.,4
"Amazing food, good location not so good interiorWent for lunch, I loved the food I ordered here and tasted amazing. The server we had was also very polite and helpful
We got a complimentry soup to start I’m not sure what it was but it’s tasted off and bad, other than that the food we had was amazing. This place is in may fair but the design and seating of this place is terrible designed. I’m tiny not sure how a tall person would walk around this restaurant or even stand comfortably, the toilets were not great door would not lock for the ladies. There is not a comfortable plc to sit here.
I really wanted to give this restaurant 5*, but the interior and restaurant set up ruined it for me",4
"Great food, wobbly serviceThe food here was absolutely excellent and definitely merits a visit-- the warm dolmeh were amazing as was the chicken kebab. However the service was strange, with mixed up orders, wrong drinks delivered, and confusion on the waiter's part about what we had ordered and what the kitchen was out of. Still, worth it for the quality!",4
"Cozy and nice, in the heart of MyfairA small but confortable restaurant, where you will find the tipical lebanese-arabian specialties: hummus, lentil soup, ot bread, and then meat, chicken or fish, fresh and well prepared. Wine and beers, as a western dinner requires. Prices are cheap for the zone and service is more than gentle.",4
"Fantastic quality of food | , я русскаяI’ve tried Iranian food before but this is the best I’ve ever had. The service was great and the food lovely. Very high quality food and robust portions. Highly recommended!",4
"OutstandingJust had dinner with friends at Iran restaurant, I just had to leave a review. The owner was very nice, and the food was the best food I’ve had in a long time, I had the mixed grill the chicken was so tender and soft the chops were amazing and the rice was out of this world I normally leave the rice but I had to finish it. I would 100% recommend going to this restaurant.",5
"Excellent service and foodFirst and foremost, my friends and I were served by a smiling waiter named Jamshid. It was their first time to have Iranian cuisine and they were so impressed. Jamshid was knowledgeable and kind, with warm eyes and an inviting smile. The environment of the restaurant is intimate and cozy, which gave us an instant feeling of comfort. The diners were international, of all ages, and everyone around us seemed to enjoy themselves just as much as we did. As for the food, great! The gems of the dinner were the dolmeh (stuffed vine leaves), which were some of the best I have ever had, the chicken tachine was mouth-watering and the baklawa and mint tea were just what we needed to finish our meal. Excellent choice! Thanks Jamshid for your hospitality and recommendations!",5
Hidden Gem!Great food and authentic experience. We caught up with a friend and found this lovely restaurant. Great atmosphere and nice menu. Fantastic service. Kubede was delicious!,5
Great restaurant and friendly staff!Came here with a friend based on a recommendation from another and friend and we had an amazing time! The food was absolutely delicious (special thanks to the chef!!). Definitely recommend and I’m sure I’ll be back here soon :),5
"Food recommendationThe food is very delicious, one of the best restaurants in london. I advise people to try it. Im from UAE , the food tastes so nice similar to irani restaurants in our country.",5
"Wonderful Dining Experience from A-Z!We were welcomed warmly and seated at a table on the street which was more of a lane between a number of restaurants and hookah bars. Perfect atmosphere for our meal of nan bread, our appetizers of dolmas, a spinach yogurt, and the number 14 (can’t remember the name) which was a rich and savory dish of diced eggplant, onions and egg. Even though we didn’t order the 14, the waiter wanted us to try it and brought it on spec. It was so good we got a second round of that with a dinner of tachine chicken and mixed grill with chicken, lamb, and marinated lamb. All of the meet was cooked to perfection and accompanied by the delicious saffron rice and a salad. When we asked for the check, they brought us tea and baklava on the house. Even though we started this trip in Paris for 5 nights, this was the best meal of our trip so far!",5
Very good Iranian restaurant!Very good Iranian restaurant. The host and staff very friendly. Highly recommended if you are looking for Iranian cousine in London.,5
"Great Persian Food With A Nice Mayfair AmbianceI came here with a group of friends for dinner, the service was good the food presentation and portions was great and the taste was fantastic! Definitely coming here again.",5
Fantastic foodWe were looking for somewhere authentic to eat and found it here. Absolutely beautiful food and great service. We were made to feel very welcome and really enjoyed eating here.,5
"The most amazing food in the area.We were looking for a good dinner. Instead we came upon this fantastic place. It has amazing food, great service, and the owner makes you feel like you are at home, by stopping by inquiring about the food, bringing dishes, and making sure our experience has been nothing short but the best. If your in the area, make sure to stop by, you won’t be sorry!",5
Loud music ruined our breakfastReally disappointing. Incredibly loud music. We couldn’t hear ourselves speak. We asked 4 times for the music to be turned down. No one listened or offered to move us to a quieter space. They just dismissed our requests. We were there for breakfast and our experience was totally ruined. No one wants to hear rock music over breakfast.,1
"Poor service, poor attitude, average food.Following a glowing recommendation, we decided to give this place a shot...ERROR!!!

Once we were seated it took 30 minutes for a single drink to arrive...the restaurant was empty. The waiter then informed us only half of the menu was available. Cue another long wait before orders were taken. Once food had arrived, it quickly became apparent two of us weren’t expected to eat (I saw the lady write down my order as well), and another person’s food was cold in the middle.

When we spoke to the manager, to be fair he removed service charge and my ‘forgotten’ meal, he couldn’t even mutter an apology. Grow a backbone.

Pathetic service and over priced food (if it’s even available), won’t bother making the effort next time.

Good luck if you do make the effort",1
"Service so bad, i was waiting for a camera crew to jump out any minute and indicate it was all a prank!!I dont leave many bad reviews, however i just cant let this slide.

This place is so staggeringly poor on the service front, it is an abomination.

What astounded me was the sheer volume of staff was so high, and yet they were so lacking in care or attention.

This place operates in the fashion that the staff think they are all very cool and special and that customers are lucky to be allowed in the door..!

Shocking.

Its a pretty nice space, they have done well with what was once an old boozer and then a restaurant which failed in quick and spectacular fashion

The food wasn't too bad either but the service was so lamentable, that it left me angry for much of the following 24 hours.

"All day breakfast - so randomly disappointedHaving moved to the area recently I was excited to try this much hyped restaurant for brunch, the occasion was doubly special as I had guests visiting and had assured them this would be the highlight of the trip.

Disappointed is an understatement.

Out of a party of three, two people ordered the pancakes with berries with one person making it clear that they didn't want any blueberries on their pancake as they were allergic to these. The waitress repeated this and appeared to scribble something on her notepad. From this point we waited 45 minutes and no food had appeared, a large family of four had arrived after us and were tucking into their food happily. Upon inquiring as to the status of our food, we were informed that our order was delayed as the kitchen had ran out of pancake batter. I found this interesting as at least one member of the family which had arrived after us were definitely eating pancakes. 15 minutes after this our food arrived, a full hour after our order being taken. Lo and behold the request to omit blueberries had been totally ignored. Upon informing the waitress that this order was in fact incorrect, we were met with a roll of the eyes. The food eventually arrived however the waitress had neglected to put any cutlery on the table and we had to ask the table next to us if we could borrow some of theirs.

The food itself was average, the avocado and eggs poorly seasoned with dull rye bread and the pancakes sickly saccharine with and without blueberries. The one saving grace was that the coffee was decent. To round off a pretty miserable experience, the waitress taking payment had the temerity to include the 'optional' service charge without once giving the opportunity to opt in or out.

My advice, save your money and head elsewhere in the area for better service and better food.",1
"CockroachesHi Raf

Thank you for your feedback on your recent visit to Cambridge Street Kitchen. Firstly I'd like to apologize for the level of service you received, I myself know how frustrating it is to be on the receiving end of poor service, at a much lower standard than I was expecting. It's difficult to handover money for something you just don't feel was worth it in the end.

As Cafe manager I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize for the whole experience as it doesn't match our standards we normally try and work to. There are many things that we try and make sure happen in a situation such as yours that didn't and we're taking steps to ensure these things occur with a decreasing frequency.

It's only with continual support and feedback from locals such as yourself and guests from further afield that we can try and improve what we do so for that I thank you for the review as now I'm positive we can improve. As such I'd love the opportunity to try and win you over, be dealt with professionally and hospitably by myself and what is normally an A-team of waiters, chefs, and bartenders.

My name is Leu and I run the service each day at Cambridge Street and I would like to extend an invite for lunch/brunch on the house at your earliest convenience?

You can also email me leu@cambridgestreet.co.uk. I look forward to welcoming you again to Cambridge Street Kitchen.

Best regards,

"Terrible value, terrible serviceI have been to this restaurant about 5 times since it opened for breakfast, lunch, dinner and also just drinks. The cocktail bar is very cool and the staff are passionate - just don't bank on getting a drink pre dinner because they will only serve you if you have a seat - very unlikely on a Friday night given they have hardly any seats.

I had brunch there today and ordered sausages, toast, bacon and beans with a carrot and orange smoothie (the kale one which I originally ordered was not available, just like the steak was unavailable for dinner the last time I went). The orange and carrot smoothie was delicious. The sausages, beans and toast were cold so I sent it back. Bear in mind this was a £15 breakfast and it came with 1 slice of toast, a spoon full of beans and 3 dried up (what looked like economy sausages). So the waitress apologised and said that the chef will fix it - I said 'he's going to cook new sausages, right, not just warm up the old ones' to which she relied 'the chef will fix it'.

Of course, he just warmed up the old ones so they were now even more dried up and shrivelled like a school dinner with my bite marks out of 2 of them where I previously tried them.

I asked the waitress if she would eat it and of course she said 'no'

I did get a free juice but honestly, I just cannot believe they would do that. It must have been 80 pence of food on that plate that they couldn't be bothered to replace.

This place has so much potential given there is nothing like it in Pimlico and the decor is amazing. PLUS I know the chef is really really good as I have watched him cook and his steak (when available) is delicious. But sometimes it just amazes me what decisions a restaurant makes when serving customers.",1
"What a shamblesHi Gekko888

Many thanks for taking the time to share your review. I know from having spoken to my Floor Manager that things didn't go entirely smoothly during your visit. What I do think is a shame is that you haven't highlighted the attempts we made to put things right.

What you ordered wasn't the £14 full breakfast that we advertise on the menu, but for ease of ordering we explained that we should process the order this way, just serving the items you did want, and we then would apply a discount at the end as this worked out better value for you than ordering a toast basket and selection of sides.

We also accepted that the dish wasn't as hot as it should've been when served and the entire meal, plus drinks were offered on the house - my floor manager also gave you both a fresh baked muffin from our counter selection which you complimented us on and seemed to enjoy.

As I hope those reading our reviews can see, we do our very best to offer great service, on the rare occasions that things don't go well we will bend over backwards to make it up to our valued guests and I feel that this should've been reflected in your review.

I truly hope that you'll give us another try and I would like to take care of your reservation personally when you do return - please email me directly and I'll ensure that you experience the very best of what we offer: liam@cambridge street.co.uk

"Child portion for an overpriced Sunday RoastHi have to say I love your restaurant but I was left tonight feeling well and turbot disgusted. My friend and I had dinner at your restaurant and then went to the bar to have our desert only to find out half way through your cheese board you had cockroaches. As we were leaving upon discovering the creepy disgusting creatures your bar staff disclosed that they were aware of the creatures but allowed us to eat down there. I'm left feeling extremely disgusted and disappointed as we love your restaurant.

I only agreed to leave by settling the bill as my friend asked me not to create a fuss.

It is not ok and needs addressing.",1
"Awful service, awful experience, do not recommend.Came here for brunch for the third time, thinking (mistakenly) that the poor service last time I came might have been a one-off.

Our order wasn't taken until 40 minutes after we arrived despite asking the waitress repeatedly. Two of five plates of food came around half an hour later, however the portion size was frankly absurd for the price and the rocket salad included with the dish was not to be found. On asking the waitress for the missing rocket salad, she returned the dishes with a fine sprinkling of chopped rocket and had to be sent back again before we were given a small bowl of plain rocket to share between two. When we then asked after the other three plates of food, we were told that the reason two plates had come out early was because they were due for another table but mistakenly brought to us instead. The other food then took a further 15 minutes to arrive, by which time the original plates were completely cold.

The service was unacceptably poor on a very basic level - the manager did give us 20% off our bill by way of compensation but I still wouldn't come back. Last time I was here the service was also poor and they ""ran out"" of pancakes. Baffling.",1
"Dirty, over-priced, slow service, small portions of average food.Early supper en famille, in the funky little gaff.
Cute decor.
Slow, but friendly, hip, service.
Drinks and food took a long time to arrive and were just average.
Evening somewhat spoiled by the huge turd and splattered diarrhoea in the ladies loo - reported to staff but not dealt with during our 2.5 hour visit.
Vastly inflated prices for under seasoned, underwhelming food.
Drinks penny too.
Go for cocktails after work when someone else is paying and take antibacterial wipes perhaps...",2
"Sunday breakfast - no salmon, burnt toast, tiny poached eggs - maybe better pre-weekend.Hi Mauskin!

Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback. We are pleased that the atmosphere and service were pleasant!
We pride ourselves on our freshly prepared food so we would like to apologise if the meals did not meet expectations on your visit to us this time around! The feedback will be sent through to our kitchen team for future improvements!
We appreciate that you reported the incident mentioned in your review to a member of our staff.
We do check our facilities several times during service, however we cannot always stop situations like this happening.

Hope to see you again!

"Quirky spot, horrendous service...We arrived on Sunday morning for a table booked at 11.30/12.

I ordered poached eggs on sourdough with Salmon and after waiting for around 15 mins was told there was no smoked salmon left - which is quite odd for a Sunday morning breakfast! So I ended up just ordering poached eggs on sourdough with smashed avocado.

My friend had ordered the avocado with chilli dish and was told they had no chilli, so she just ordered eggs on toast and we shared the smashed avocado - which was lovely but not hard to do!

When the food arrived, the sourdough was so burnt I had to send it back - and when it came back the eggs were cold and the toast wasn't that much better than before! Also the eggs are the smallest I've ever seen! For the price you would expect large eggs, rather than small!

My eggs were also very runny but I didn't want to have to send them back again as the waitress didn't appear to be someone who would care, so just left it - especially being right by the chefs cooking!

I think it's a lovely place with great decor but maybe Sunday morning isn't the best time to get the best out of the place and there was a feel for zero care for service.

Overall, it just felt there was no care for the customer service or food, so won't be returning.",2
"Disappointed Cambridge restaurantWe were staying around the corner in Eccleston Sq. and after a quick search found this place, which looked lovely and the food options looked very good. The welcoming staff were very good, and we managed to get a table at around 11.20am on a Sunday, which was good as it did look busy.

After placing our order, we were politely asked if we could move to a smaller table, in order to accommodate a larger group on our existing table. We were more than happy to do so, as it was just the next table down. We had ordered watter, coffee and mains, after 45mins of waiting, none of those items had arrived! I enquiried with a waitress as to where our order was, and she said she would go and check. A further 10mins later she still had not come back to us with any information or our drinks, at this stage I wasn’t willing to wait any longer. I got up to enquire with her again, and she explained that our order had been lost, and our coffees would be ready in another 5mins. This was just not acceptable as we had places to be, so she said we could have them as a takeaway. Without so much as an apology or any kind of acknowledgement that they had been incompetent in their lack of service, she bought our bill over to me.

When leaving, I had a word with the welcoming staff, explaining the situation, and she asked if ‘they’d’ offered any kind of discount or compensation for the lack of service, to which the reply was absolutely not. Why is the service so disjointed? Communication definitely needs to be addressed in this eatery, as well as basic customer service skills! I wouldn’t go back.",2
"one hour for foodI was so disappointed 2nd time the way we were seated squeezed in a corner, waiting staff kept trying to take food to next table it was such an uncomfortable table.
We were not happy.
We decided to give them another go today we went there after disappointing experience last year 2nd chance.
We were seated ok we asked for some bread and olives before our main and couple of drinks, it took ages for bread and olives to come the main course came out and they wanted to serve everything together, so disappointed I told them to send it back and the waiter was useless lack of coordination not sure if they were under staffed.
The wine I have noticed they serve 125 ml of wine some restaurants are doing this now its such a rip off.
Anyway we walked out we didn't wait for starters and I wont be going back there again.
Such a shame because decor and the cocktail bar really nice, the problem with these restaurants they get a good name and become busy, then they slack.

We came back to Cambridge as we were invited back for a meal on the house, which I have to say was lovely the service was great, and it really made us want to come back again this was in may, we came back last week Saturday evening for dinner it was terrible I had steak my daughter had lamb they didn’t ask how she wanted it cooked, it tasted fishy so it seems they put the anchovi sauce on the lamb as well as the steak the lamb was way under cooked the service was not much better when you serve wine out off a bucket off water you put a napkin underneath the bottle so it doesn’t drip on the diners this is what happened it dripped on to my bag.
The service was uncordinated, and I think the menu is not brilliant.
The salad we didn’t eat fruit fly deside to fly into it.
Such a shame because we wanted to go downstairs to the bar after and have a cocktail just the whole thing put us off.
A lovely place nice decor but they really need to sort out staff and food preparation and menu,",2
"Don't botherWe visited this establishment 2 days ago. We had prebooked our table, not that it seemed to matter. It has a really nice, relaxed atmosphere, and we soon realised it was very relaxed. It was 25 minutes before we got a menu and another 15 to give our order. one hour after arriving , we got our food. We ordered a couscous and vegetable dish, a blt which comes with fries and a side of smoked salmon and sweet potato fries. The waitress made a point of telling us that chips came with the blt, to which we said that we wanted the extra sweet potato fries as we were hungry........when we did get our food, the sweet potato fries were yummy, my husband had the couscous dish and he was very impressed by it and my blt was good-no chips arrived with it---since we had waited so long for our food we did not comment on the lack of chips.
Everybody seemed to be waiting a very long time for their food-a couple near us were waiting 50 minutes for theirs - a poached egg dish finally arrived at their table.

If you want an incredibly relaxed place and are not very hungry, in no rush to go anywhere, then this is the place for you. If like us you had been travelling for 8 hours since early that morning and hadn't eaten since the night before, then this is definitely NOT the place for you.",2
"Very poor service, good food, uncomfortable outside areaThe food was nice but plenty of other places serve nice food nearby. The waitress was lovely but there are plenty of nice waitresses. Toast was sourdough or sourdough. Breakfast took over half an hour with no explanation or apology. Coffee came quickly with no sugar which had to be asked for. Breakfast came slowly with no salt or pepper which had to be asked for. I was planning a birthday brunch here but won't be coming back. Ever.",2

"Unsatisfactory and unapologeticThis place looks very promising and has a good ambience. Visited on Sunday 27th May.

We sat outside but the tables are tight and on a real lateral slope so it’s most uncomfortable - recommend inside.

The waiter was nice but our drinks didn’t arrive so we reminded him. The table was not correctly set or wiped (had to ask).

Food arrived (was ok). Food finished, still no drinks.

15 mins after finishing food, waiter said drinks order was lost; so we reordered them.

To be fair, they removed the drinks from our bill.

Not recommended.",2

Thank you for letting us know about your experience, I am very sorry to hear about your service on Sunday 27th.

"DisappointingI cancelled my original Brunch venue to celebrate two of our children's significant birthdays pre-threatre and was hugely disappointed. The venue is lovely and promised so much when you walk in. We were expected and welcomed & shown to our reservation so beautifully however it was truly downhill thereafter. Service painfully slow. It is a busy restaurant but clearly not enough staff to cater for the covers. When our order was taken the drinks and food came out together sometime later. the food was tasty but not good enough for the prices charged. Two small fried eggs on the thinnest slice of toast cost £8. To add to the misery many items just were not available on the menu for instance no flatbread and no pan au chocolate - at 11.30 is a worry.
Sadly this was not worth the trip from North London.",3

"Front of house a bit of a let-down.A lovely little quirky restaurant. We just had a light lunch. The food was good. The atmosphere was relaxed. However the staff really let it down. Our food took ages- which would be fine except we could see it sitting on the counter waiting, just going cold. To make it worse someone brought their dog and the waitress was stroking it right by the open kitchen (and where our food was sitting waiting) and the dog was shaking itself, hair floating in the air...all v unhygienic. She eventually brought our food, but brought my husband the wrong dish. He started eating it and then she came back, took it off him and gave it straight to someone else! Then took absolutely ages to get and pay bill. We were staying in the hotel above, but decided to go elsewhere for breakfast the next day.",3
"Nice food and venue, service distractedThis was our third visit and was not as good as the first two. The food and surroundings were excellent, but the front of house was disappointing.

Our initial greeting was rather perfunctory and we were initially shown to an unnecessarily poor table squashed up against a wall, when there were plenty of others available.

However, the main problem was the rather chaotic waitress service, with orders being taken to the wrong table on three or four occasions. In addition, witnesses had continually had to be 'chased' for everything from the menu to the bill.

The final, rather annoying incident, was that on seeing that there was both vanilla ice-cream and espresso coffee on the menu, we asked for an afogato. The waitress said fine, 'why not?' but the front of house manager initially said 'No' until we persisted. An incident that was rather illustrates the front of house problem.

Will we be back? Probably yes, we'll we'll give it a break for a while.",3
"Poor service, good foodI ate here for brunch at the weekend. The food was good (typical brunch fare) but we found it hard to catch the waiters attention when paying, and waited 40 mins for our food. The restaurant wasn't busy. We also ordered a brownie from the dessert menu. It arrived as a single small brownie cut in half on the plate. We asked if we could have a small scoop of ice cream with it (which I think is reasonable to expect when getting a brownie as a dessert, as opposed to in a coffee shop etc). This arrived 10 mins later at which point the brownie was nearly finished, and were charged 1.50 for the scoop.
Lots of potential but wasn't really charmed enough to rush back.",3
"Slow Service & Limited MenuLovely restaurant with diverse menu but poor service. We and clients from other tables had to go find the waiter/waitress to ask for our order to be taken, forgot the bring water etc. Pity as the food was great but don’t think I’d go again.",3
"Bad and GoodDear Sir or Madam,

I have to apologise for your poor service that you received from us on your visit. We are currently re-training our staff so that they know our correct steps of service, so that instances of not bringing any water to the table should not happen. I also apologise that you had to chase up someone to take your order, I understand how frustrating this can be. However, I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your food! thank you for letting us know about this.

I have written a personal message to yourself so that we can resolve this, and hope that we can change your mind about wanting to come back.

"Beautiful place but without the service to matchI went here for brunch on a Saturday morning before an event in the hotel. The menu is rather restrictive and limited. Unfortunately, the kitchen had run out of some menu choices. We ordered right on the border of brunch and lunch. But the chef wouldn't start cooking lunch. Such a shame! Slow and disinterested wait staff. Hard to get anyone's attention, despite it being a small space. A really cute restaurant but some disappointing issues.",3
"Slight Disappointing 2nd VisitGood afternoon,

I’m really sorry to hear that we didn’t’ live up to your expectations this weekend. After reading your feedback, I can understand your frustration with our service. If I could take a moment to explain…. our kitchen is extremely small and very busy at weekends so to ensure that all our guests are looked after equally, we must stick to our service times quite strictly. I can understand your frustration however and I will take on board and pass your feedback regarding the menu to our chef.

My name is Luigi and I was running the service on that day and believe me if I was in your shoes I would feel disappointed too, I know what it feels like to feel short changed by service. If I can I would like to get a little more detail on your visit so we can improve our service, so if you don’t mind please contact me personally on manager@arlondon.co.uk so we can find a way to win you back and prove that we really do pride ourselves on amazing service and hospitality.

slipping a bitWe enjoyed our dinner but this visit was not up to the level of previous visits. It may be that the staff on a Sunday night are not their first stringers. they have reconfigured the restaurant and we like being in a booth but not next to the dishwasher. My lamb had an excellent sauce and presentation but the cut of meat could have been a better cut.,4
"Cocktail barFriendly staff and nice atmosphere at the cocktail bar downstairs. They have some amazing specialty cocktails named after movies ranging from 8 to 12 pounds. I had the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and it was pretty amazing. Fresh herbs and refreshing. They also have snacks and I had rosemary fries. The fries were good, but I could not taste any rosemary. Definitely recommend stopping in, and I will do so again.",4

When you get served it is great and typically when I have been and not sat there it is exceptional.",4
"Nice Veg. SandwichOur lunch was tasty. This is a place where you can spend your time enjoying the staff and the food. The burger was tasty, avocado toast smooth, and the salad fresh. My subway card fell out of my bag without my knowledge. They locked it up for me and we’re so gracious when I came looking for it. It saved me $75!",4
Yummy breakfast!The staff was very helpful and they served me nice vegetarian sandwich and fries. Nice decent happening place in a quite residential locality of Pimlico.,4
"Friendly staff, Good Food, Great CocktailsWe came here as a result of yelp reviews to try some English pancakes. I say English pancakes as they are different than pancakes in the US, the pancakes here are thick and more cake-like. I really enjoyed my stripey bacon pancakes and my daughter loved her berry pancakes with creme. There were only two people working on our early Thursday morning and we were greeted immediately and sat down in a comfy booth. We had delicious coffee drinks and the food came out quickly. Unlike in the US the servers do not drop the check immediately after the food is consumed so we did have to ask for the check when we were ready. I don’t think it is bad to let us savor our time together and not be rushed do you?",4
"My favourite place in PimlicoWe enjoyed a very nice dinner at Cambridge Kitchen. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was very good at a reasonable price. Before and after our meal we visited the downstairs cocktail bar where Warren crafted excellent creative movie themed cocktails--try the Titanic!",4
A drinks party for 50 guestsI took the basement area for a private party. We had a dedicated barman who was excellent and looked after us extremely well from 6.30 to closing time! We made two visits beforehand to taste wine and discuss 'chef's boards' and on both occasions the staff were exceedingly helpful and made the whole process very easy. I would certainly recommend this place to other friends wanting to arrange a similar function.,5
"Went above and beyond!My first visit to this place and I definitely recommend it, especially if you are celebrating something special. I booked a table of 8 for a hen-do brunch and we were kindly given a free bottle of prosecco! The staff were super friendly and happy to take many photos for us all. The place is so nicely decorated, it's a fairly small place but it makes for a nice atmosphere. The portions for the avocado toast were quite small but everything else was generous. Overall, a great start to a great day! Will be taking more people here in the future.",5
"Nice place to catch up with friendsHey Bethany,

Thank you for taking the time to leave such a lovely feedback!
We are so glad you enjoyed your hen-do brunch with your friends. Whilst he is an amazing waiter it appears Giovanni is also a fab photographer!
We hope to see you very soon!

The CSK team",5
"Late night dinnerMy second visit to this lovely place . Decor a bit quirky but nice . This time was a catch up with former colleagues .
We were not chased for our table despite it being fairly busy and we spent a few hours enjoying good food , good wine and good service ,
Prices are very reasonable for this part of town .
Burgers were great , I am told the salads were also very very good .
Wine was an Fair price .
It was very busy on the evening we were there but no problem getting service when required . Staff were very nice , not obtrusive but never very far away . Although the tables are quite close we didn’t feel disturbed by our neighbouring diners .
Great chilled place to catch up .
Sadly didn’t make it down to the bar this time but I can recommend it from my previous trip.",5
"Wonderful food and friendly staffhey

thanks for reviewing us and we're so glad you enjoyed yourself with us! Really hope to see you again soon.

Regards,

the Cambridge Street team",5
"GREAT SUNDAY BRUNCHWe arrived ater 9:00pm and were advised that the kitchen was still open. We were glad it was as our meal was excellent, served in short order and hot. The girls who greeted us were very friendly and knowledgeable as was the bartender who took our drink orders.",5
"Delicious!Hey,

We're glad you enjoyed your dinner, we're really proud of the food here and the bartenders work hard on their knowledge so it's always great to be acknowledged for the hard work!

We'd love to welcome you again soon!

Kind regards,

The CSK team",5
"Well worth a visitStaff were really friendly, one of few places where it felt like staff were genuinely wanting to make sure we had everything we needed. Food was tasty, surprisingly quick for how many people were in there, they gave us too many portions of chips but that's nothing to complain about! We went back for breakfast later on our trip, which was equally as good.",5
"Fabulous brunchHi Alex,

Thank you for your lovely review! We pride ourselves on all our freshly sourced ingredients and also very happy to hear your feedback about our charismatic staff! Hope to see you again soon!

Many thanks!

CSK Team",5
"Amazingly well catered work event!There were five of us for brunch and we hadn't seen each other for a while, so we were probably a little animated and noisy. We weren't in any hurry so we have no complaints about the service and the food was just what we wanted - a little different, good value and tasty. I'd certainly go again (and had been previously - it was as good as I'd remembered). The background music was a little loud, but it was good music that suits the surroundings well.",5
Cold breakfastI have had good breakfast here before but last time I went it was woeful. I ordered eggs on toast with bacon. The eggs were hard and the bacon was way over cooked and had no taste. To add insult to injury the whole thing was cold. Coffee was good.,1
"Such a shameBeen here few times & great service & food.
But upon visiting here this morning it makes me not want to go back.

We opted to sit outside to do the staff a favour as busy but were quickly forgotten about. Waited 20 mins for drinks then another 30 mins for food.
On arrival eggs were under cooked & unable to eat them.
We left very unhappy.
It's noted that Patrick wasn't there today which is a shame as he is brilliant.",1
"Did not live up to expectationsHaving read great reviews, we decided to give this place a go for brunch on a Saturday at 11am

- Cappuccino was very average
- Ordered ""Eggs Benedict with Spinach & Ham"" and the ""T&T's Award Winning Pulled Pork Benedict"".

- Food took over one hour to be served! We had to get up and ask what was going on as there was no communication from the waitress. When it did come the excuse that was given was there were many tickets in the kitchen and the chefs were busy. I understand there can be delays but at least keep your customers in the loop.

- For two meals, two cappuccinos and a tea approx £31.
- The food itself was nothing special. Nice decor inside but we will not be going back. I'm sure the service is not normally like this given other reviews on here but this was our experience.",2
"CoffeeOnly had coffee but I thought it was terrible ... Too bitter and couldn't drink it.
None of the other people I was with seemed to have a problem though.
Nice atmosphere, pleasant staff. Have only ranked poor because of the coffee, I am sure it is generally a lovely place.",2
"DisappointingI decided to try this restaurant as it was was local to me and the reviews were excellent. I have to say I was disappointed. I ordered pouched egg on toast with avocado and bacon. The bread was sour dough bread, it was rock hard and cold. I had to spread my own butter and due to the toast being so cold it didn't melt. The egg, bacon and avocado were all in separate dishes, if I wanted to make my own breakfast I would have stayed at home. By the time I had buttered the toast, spread the avocado, and added the egg and bacon the meal it was almost cold. The bacon was streaky and to be honest was just fat and not in the least bit crispy. On the plus side the coffee was good. The toilets had a leak on the floor and were a bit smelly. I won't be going back here and there are better places for brunch. Staff were friendly and service was good.",3
"Not bad, could be betterPopular breakfast spot in West Putney. Pleasant staff and clientele. I had breakfast here, which I enjoyed but could be better in some aspects. Firstly, a regular gripe for me; no filter coffee. I never understand this. Why not? Secondly, the scrambled eggs with chorizo were not really scrambled, but a kind of unstructured omelette. The orange juice was pretty good.",3
Lovely nrunchCame here a few months ago for brunch with some friends. The food was lovely and great value. Advice was also great. Would really recommend,3
overpricedgood food and good service but I think overpriced .£75 for breakfast for 6 people[I plate each] even for trendy Putney is way over the top.In future will stick to Bill's or any oooof the numerous cafes in the area.,3
"Slightly disappointed that I was slightly disappointed!We visited Tried and True on a Sunday morning after a heavy Saturday night. I was really looking forward to the BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict (especially as another review on here had suggested it as a miracle hangover cure!). The cafe was very busy when we arrived and we had to wait 10 mins or so for a table - we were fine with that. It was nice to have a bottle of tap water on the table. The food was OK (but the star BBQ pulled pork dish wasn't anything special for me), the coffee was OK too but I did feel that the food in particular was a little expensive. It was also noisy with all the kids but that can't be helped. I'd probably go back again but I'd opt for a bacon or sausage sandwich which is probably better value for money.",3
"Nice coffee; food wasn't amazingA word of mouth recommendation took us 10 minutes out of the centre of Putney to Tried and True.

We ordered eggs Benedict, pulled pork and a couple of flat whites.

The coffee was gorgeous; their blend is smooth and their barista has skill.

Although it looked sumptuous, sadly the food didn't measure up.

The bread served with the eggs Benedict was brittle. It was served dry, with no butter or other spread. There was little moisture in this meal; a small amount of sauce graced the plate.

It was a busy atmosphere, the staff are friendly and efficient.",3
"Breakfast in the sunshineAs a retarded Northerner I am unused to the concept of going out for breakfast so a visit here with our daughter after she had won her tennis match at Putney tennis club was an unusual treat. We were fortunate inasmuch as the sun was shining and we were able to breakfast outside on their deck.

And I can only say that the quality of fare on offer was excellent. Expect to pay around £15 per head for a drink and a breakfast main course.",4
"Lovely Saturday BrunchThis lovely little cafe was recommended by a friend and it really was lovely. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was fresh and prepared really quickly especially considering how busy the restaurant was.

It is dog friendly (which we didn't know) so will definitely bring our dog along next time!

We had almond milk lattes and I would be very interested to know what almond milk they use as they were absolutely delicious.

We will be back!",4
"Nice coffee and foodHad brunch there today, recommended by a friend. Very nice place, clean, bright and cozy. Have a small garden at the back with seating.",4
"Simple, quick, tastyGreat place for a quick simple breakfast or lunch. The food was decent, nothing particularly creative but perhaps try the pulled pork dish that everyone raves about. I would go back as it is convenient and good service.",4
"Always a pleasure but avoid if you don't like childrenI love this place. Live at the other end of Putney but I'll happily go up there rather than somewhere closer

They are dog friendly inside but also have an enclosed garden out the back and seating out at the front, if yours can be rambunctious.

The menu is nicely varied but doesn't have enough vegan options really. I'd love to see large grilled portobello mushrooms as a side option, for example

The banana bread is delicious so I advise trying that.

The staff here are always SO friendly and lovely, it makes going a pleasure.

One downside is the loose leaf tea. It's WAY too weak. I always ask for it extra strong otherwise it's like dishwater, regardless of how cold I allow it to go whilst trying to brew some life into it

Note: If you're not keen on children this isn't the place for you. It's a great spot for parents to meet so it's normally fairly lively with buggies around.",4
"Enjoyable experience.Four of us visited here for a late breakfast and all were impressed by the friendly welcome, efficient service and, above all else,the quality of the food; between us, we tried several dishes e.g. eggs benedict, toasted banana bread etc. and each one received positive comments.
There was a pleasantly 'buzzy' atmosphere throughout (without being over-noisy). Recommended.",4
"Lovely brunchWe had been meaning to try TNT for so long and it didn't disappoint. Yes their mains are expensive but the portions are large. The menu is inventive and we will certainly be back. What I would say is the kids portion of pancakes could have been bigger for a 6 yr old maybe they can review this??
But really good",4
"Very nice place but surprised with the billAs mentioned in previous reviews this is a nice, clean and well presented shop. We were visiting from Australia and although new to London pricing, it seemed to be quite similar in many ways to Australia regarding service and food prices,...just a tad more expensive. I had a little free time and popped in for breakfast. Ordered the poached eggs on toast and added bacon and advocadoes. I knew it would be extra but got quite the surprise when my 6 pound order had 4 pound added for two small strips of bacon and another 4 pounds for what seemed to be a quarter of an avocado. It was nice but an increase of 133% on the original price for the extras seemed way over the top. I was going to drop the rating to 3 but decided that I might just be a bit naive.",4
"Lovely food and coffeeWe came for brunch - pancakes and coffee. Both were really tasty and well made. We were originally seated next to the door which had a bad draft, so we were moved to the back of the restaurant when somebody left (it was full when we arrived!). The staff were calm and helpful and the actual cafe was light and popular. We will be back! Quite expensive for a cafe though.",4
"GoodThe menu stated 'creamy pesto mushrooms' but there was no cream at all. Service was friendly and meal was still delicious, despite the lack of cream.",4
"Best Bruch in a long time....🕺🏼Short and sweet, but this has to be the best brunch I have had in my 2 years of living in London.

Food is amazing, service is fantastic, friendly staff. Everything mixed together makes a fantastic experience and I’ll be going back that’s for sure.

Thanks Tried and True for making it a great experience for us.",5
Always great food and serviceI go for breakfast or brunch 3/4 times a week as it’s my local cafe. The food is consistently excellent and the staff and management consistently impressive. Great customer service.,5
Eat here every week never disappointsThis is a great spot well made coffee and a great selection of egg dishes. It also has an outdoor space. Totally cool for breakfast or Brunch. Staff are efficient and friendly.,5
"Lovely placeHad breakfast here with family yesterday. Menu is interesting, to say the least. My daughter in law had smashed avocado on toast with poached eggs which looked and tasted great. Can't remember what my son ordered- it certainly wasn't on his plate for long. I had toasted banana bread with Greek yoghurt & honey and it was delicious. Staff are friendly, efficient and helpful. And my tea was perfect- real flavoursome tea served in a pot. Super place for a weekend breakfast.",5
"Great, friendly serviceDespite me arriving with a huge double buggy and noisy toddler, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Great sausage sandwich for the toddler! Glad they didn’t charge me the adult portion.",5
"New Favorite Brunch SpotPlace is fantastic, busy, and very friendly.

They've got awesome food - we left with clean plates and everything else we saw around looked really good.

The staff was super friendly, the restaurant likes kids and dogs.

We are definitely coming back.

I don't usually complain about food, and this one is a pseudo-complaint... The barbecue pork eggs Benedict is not for me. The sauce was much too sweet. I'm probably just spoiled by the good stuff back home in the states.

Anyway, you might like it more than I did.",5
"Would visit againVisited at a busy time on Saturday, I was seated quickly, and the service was prompt. The hot chocolate was delicious. I had avocado on gluten free toast with feta cheese which was also tasty and fresh (though you put the avocado on the toast yourself!). It’s a very spacious and light cafe, and I would absolutely visit again when I’m next in the area.",5
Another great visitOver from Australia for a few days had the pork benny and banana cake! Was great! Martina served us and and was lovely! Oh and a great soy latte!,5
"Amazing selection of food!Went on a Sunday for a late brunch and was amazed by the selection of food they had to offer- was difficult to decide! Settled on the pancakes which were delicious.
Food did take a while to come but it was very busy and a Sunday morning so it didn't detract much from the visit,
Would recommend!",5
Fav local brunch spotThis is my absolute favorite spot for brunch in Putney. The coffee and food is on point and the service is always great. Love it!,5
Take outOrder a bacon sarnie on brown bread and got a stale white bap with one fatty under cooked in edible bacon.top it off with brown sauce... Specifically requested none! Twice! Straight in the bin! Waste Wouldn't go back wasn't particularly friendly either.,1
"RudeJust went into Heap's for lunch and asked if they take card (it's a tiny little place and I was only going to get a sandwich so was anticipating a minimum spend). The tall, young, brunette man looked at me like I was an alien for a good minute and eventually said ""uh yeah"" like I was a complete idiot. Completely unnecessary, he was clearly having a bad day and wanted to take it out on someone.",1
"Disappointing...I've been based in Greenwich for a while and have heard good things about Heaps so decided to give it a go and order breakfast from UberEATS.

The order was quick to arrive which was great. When it arrived, it was presented really well and it was still very warm so I was looking forward to what I thought would be an enjoyable breakfast. I unfortunately ended up being rather disappointed.

The sausages were really under-cooked, pink and stringy in the inside, with the skin being really tough and greasy. The mushrooms looked like they were going to be amazing but were tasteless and bland. The portion size of beans was genuinely one table spoon, which made the whole meal rather dry.

Considering the price that Heaps charge, I was expecting something of high quality, which this definitely was not. I wouldn't eat from here again.",1
"""VEGETARIAN BREAKFAST""Completely outraged in this restaurant I order 2 VEGETARIAN breakfast as I'm vegetarian my self i ordered through UberEATS and when my order was delivered it was not vegetarian it was a full English breakfast including bacon and sausages, Disappointed as I was I rang the restaurant and ask kindly if I could get this issue resolved and get another breakfast sent out. I was advised by the rudest person on the phone that I would need to resolve this with Uber does this make sense to you? I explained that uber have done there job and the fault was with the restaurant so I asked to speak with a manager I was then advised I was speaking to the manager and the owner himself. I was then told by the owner in a very aggressive manner ""If you don't want to eat breakfast here go and get your breakfast from somewhere else"" where he then proceeded to put the phone down on me. Now I have been left to run around to get a refund and do the work for this restaurant to contact uber? Surely this would be a job for the person who made me the wrong breakfast and could of made me ill if I proceeded to eat this. So with that being said if you want disgraceful customer service THIS IS THE PLACE. If your vegetarian I merely advise you not to order from here.",1
"terrible servicewent in .whilst it was busy, I was ignored by all the staff who proceeded to serve people who came into the shop before me. Totally disorganised very disappointed and they do not deserve custom.",1
"terrible, slow service and no organisationI was waiting for over 25 minutes and did not get served. The staff served several people before us and we walked out in fury.",1
"UNDERCOOKED MEAT !!'the place only had a handful of cutomers so went in ordered a tea and coffee ,waited ages no show so then was asked again what i ordered eventually the drinks and 2 breakfast orders turned up together and the sausges and bacon looked dreadful the bacon was really overcooked and the sausages where still extremely raw and un cooked with just a brown stripe on one side showing they had been cooked just for a few mins burning the outside and leaving the middle raw, when i complained i was given the tea and coffee for free and a very short sorry !! on the way put i noriced a plate on the table outside with no customers just an uneaten yet cut into sausage left on the plate !! now i genuinely dont believe the place sells uncooked sausages all the time but i genuinely do believe they rushed the order as they forgot it and look how its ended up. The moral here is Dont rush the orders and serve raw food as no one minds waiting for food to be cooked properly because no one likes to eat raw sausages .",1
"I wont go back and I love a sausage Sandwich!!Moved to Greenwich, decided to try this nice looking, little Sausage shop. We went in, it's cramped but we wanted a couple of sausage rolls to take out so no big deal.

Got approached by someone after around 4-5 minutes of standing at the counter and were asked what we wanted. 2 Sausage rolls and two coffees. They re-heated the sausages from a 'job lot' that they keep by the Grill.

That's OK, I don't have a problem with that as long as it's a quick turnaround from when they were initially cooked.

Anyway, took our takeaway rolls into Greenwich Park, sat on a bench and took a bite...

Luke warm and even though it was reheated it was still slightly pink and almost raw in places, definitely under cooked anyways.

I really couldn't bring myself to eat it so just drank my coffee which was quite nice. My wife ate hers and though not happy with the pink, under cooked meat in the roll, she was happy enough but not that impressed.

I left mine on the bench to put in the bin when we had finished our coffee but a Dog ran up and stole the bag and ate the roll and sausage. Good luck to him!!!

Won't go back.

I like the idea, I like the layout of the little 'shoppe' but my one experience has killed it for me.
A shame as I wanted to make it a regular haunt as it were.",1
"Creek Rd: Bland food, slow serviceI had already planned to try their famous sausages so the Groupon deal eased that plan..
Unfortunately the burger was tasteless (go for the local Byton for proper ones), mash was a bit bland but fresh. I also ordered a sausage bap and it was better (especially the bap, it should be mandatory for burger where the bun was a cheap one) for 3.9 pounds to take away.
Staff: 2 young people, kind but they lost twice my order (they served customers arrived after me before I got my burger), it took 20 minutes to get the infamous burger and other 20 for the sausage bun.

Since the experience was bad and I couldn't recommend the food, I cannot even rate it as poor but just quite wrong to be still in business..",1
"The only good thing was the serviceThe breakfast here was awful. The potato rosti tasted like old mashed potato that had been fried up, the sausages were very dry and bland and the mushrooms looked like a pre-sliced tin job swimming in cream. Only good thing was the beans, thanks Mr Heinz.

Wished we'd gone to Wetherspoons across the road, would've been cheaper and slightly better quality.

This place is taking the mick.",1
"Undercooked sausages- really surprisedSuper surprised at this place giving underdone sausages with that awful stringyness when you eat them. Mash was freezing and gravy tasted of nothing.
Will try again another time as I feel this isn’t the measure of Heaps due to other positive reviews, but just because one visits toward the latter half of the day doesn’t mean quality should slip.",2
"worst veggie sausages i ever haddisappointing that for a place which prides itself on the quality of its breakfasts that the veggie is so hard done by. seriously, any frozen sausage in a supermarket is better than theirs. not acceptable in London in this day and age. they were dry and tasteless and would put anyone off trying meat free options. I told staff they were awful, and they just looked blankly. If a customer is willing to be honest with you, you should ask them what they didn't like. waitress just said she had never tried them!",2
"promised more than it deliveredVery disappointing experience despite the place looking good from the outside. The vegetarian sausage was one of the worst I have eaten and was like a throwback to the type comedians used to ridicule in the 70s and 80s. Dry, sawdusty and tastless.The meat sausage was average and with an undercooked skin. The Bacon was good, the eggs broken and overcooked and the overall meal was not good and the offhand service didn't help. There are a lot of good reviews on here so maybe we caught them on a bad day but we won't be back. Interesting loo though and not too expensive.",2
"Got moved as we sat down to our sausage and mashPortion sizes were very small, we ordered sausage and mash and thats exactly what you get two sausages and a scoop of mash and gravy, no veg. We sat outside which was lovely and waited around 25-30 minutes for our water to arrive. Just as our food turned up we were moved as the wine bar next door needed his table back. We had to move the two dogs, two plates and drinks over to a table and squash up with other customers. Sausages were good but portion sizes measly.",2
"Losing its charm and service a bit batiedI’ve eaten here many times and previously rated this establishment highly. However I think standards have slipped and staff are now quite arrogant and patronising.

For example I had breakfast in here and ordered a take away as well. I also asked If they did porridge. The answer a sneering NO! Hmm is that necessary?

Also despite premium tea they taste a bit soapy. Not sure if the cups had been rinsed sufficiently.

Lastly. They only do one type of bread muffin like. Won’t toast and won’t do brown. Unusual at first but WHY given the choice in the surrounding area. Next day I went somewhere else.",3
"MediumGreat location and shop appearance. Really fantastic flat white coffee but the main event - the Heap bacon, sausage and egg bun lacked flavour and satisfaction especially given the waiting time and the price. This place is a place to be seen at rather than a place to enjoy really great food. And don't look at the handling of wet raw bacon with the same bare hands that pick up the buns to be warmed and filled with the cooked food",3
Not best choice for vegetarianI wanted to have a vegetarian English breakfast and I have read all the nice reviews which are true if you are meat eater but not otherwise. Friendly staff and alternative milk choices but the veggies sausages were not so great. A bit overprice considering what I had. I also want to thanks the Italian waiter to help me recharging my mobile while I was having my meal.,3
"Not the wurst...I came here for brunch on bank holiday Monday with my boyfriend excited to try the sausages (I had read good reviews).

The cafe is small but with outside seating in the shade which was great on a hot hot day!
I ordered the breakfast hot dog and my boyfriend ordered the full English. We asked for a jug of tap water and it never arrived. We had to wait for our food to arrive to ask for water again. In the heat we were practically melting without water!

The food was tasty although the sausage wasn't anything special. The dishes are reasonably priced and hit the spot.",3
"Sausage festGrabbed a late breakfast here with my girlfriend. We asked for tap water but it never came. We had to ask for it a second time. I ordered the full english and it tasted very good, the bacon, egg and mushrooms.
The sausages were unremarkable, I've had the same if not better when buying from a supermarket.
The place is small inside, so get a table outside if you can.",3
Working at TheatreGreat place to eat But be aware they open at 730 which they don't. Arrived for food before work and the lady working kicked us out I'm not open I'm not open. Don't advertise you open at 730 if you don't. I'd have give full marks has it not been for this,3
"AverageVisited on Wednesday for Breakfast/Lunch was really disappointed after reading some good reviews. The service and the interior was great but the food wasn't up to the standards I was expecting. We ordered tow breakfasts, They gave you mixed sausages with the breakfast which one was nice the rest not so much. The bacon was over done and had a really weird tasting tinge off it. The half roll/bun wasn't even toasted and beans tasted as though they where either cheap or watered down. Mushrooms where lovely though.

Wouldn't return or recommend.

The staff where really friendly though and service was good but the food wasn't for me.",3
"Food good, service not.Heaps serves a nice breakfast. The price is somewhat reasonable for Greenwich and they really do serve nice sausages. Unfortunately the waiting staff need a smile adding to their faces. We were asking if we 'minded moving tables' half way through our meal because a larger party had just arrived and needed a bigger table, like the one our party was sat at. Quite rude and unexpected when eating your meal. Sadly this made us feel unwelcome and has had a negative impact on our thoughts to return.",3
"Great menu but room for improvementWe've been living in Umbria for a little while now, where there is certainly no shortage of really fine restaurants. However, while they routinely serve up outstanding Italian cuisine which is very satisfactory indeed, I still fancy a full English breakfast from time to time. Therefore, when we go back to London once in a while, I make a point of seeking out a full English and assessing the current state of the art.

So this took me to Heap's Sausages in Greenwich, where we stayed a week or 2 back. I'd been to Heaps before and found its menu to be just the job for me. Everything that my wife finds disgusting and unhealthy. Absolutely perfect!! However, despite that, I came away with some reservations.

My full-English plate was described on the menu as containing 2 of the number 1 sausages, some mushrooms, baked beans, bacon and egg which I could order according to my fancy, (fried, poached, scrambled etc). The plate was to be accompanied by toast of my choice of bread. When I received my meal, however, I found that I had 1 fried egg which sat atop the bottom half of a muffin. That was my toast apparently and I was a little disappointed with that, although the egg was excellent as was the bacon, which was slightly burnt as it should be and which I love. The mushrooms were OK but the 2 sausages were a bit of a let down, given that it is the quality and range of sausages around which the diner is centred. They were OK, but not unforgettable, being average sized and a little chewy.

So although I still enjoyed my visit to Heaps, I felt it could have been better. The price was very reasonable and I should also add that, although it is my own taste to have the full-on English breakfast cooked in the traditional way, Heaps do provide a fine vegetarian alternative as well.

I shall return to Heaps I'm sure, for I really like Greenwich, and I shall reassess then.",3
Nothing specialHeard good things about this place. Had the breakfast but I thought the sausages were undercooked and a bit tasteless. Overall - average breakfast.,3
"Very Friendly ServiceWe decided to go on a Sunday morning to try out the sausages. They were really lovely. However, there is a little wait for a table. But it was worth it. We ordered the full breakfast. Bacon, sausages are gorgeous. The cream mushroom were nice, but a bit stingy on quantity. The egg was fried disappointingly though. Would recommend for the experience.",4
Great little placeThe staff were friendly and the prices reasonable. A quaint little place. I just had a bap from the great range of sausages which was tasty and served with a smile,4
"Super sausagesLovely little cafe. Cosy little wooden booths. Good quality sausage, bacon and eggs. Great tasting and large cup of coffee",4
"Best Breakfast🍳Visited here for the first time yesterday morning and so glad I did. Everything about the all day breakfast was really good. The sausages, bacon, egg, beans..all of it. There really is nothing to complain about the food.
The reason I am only giving it 4/5 is because of the cafe itself, it’s not the most inviting and could do with an uplift. I am most looking forward to another Heap’s opening up right near where I live. X",4
"All day breakfastSausages made on the premises, dried cured bacon, baked beans, toasted bun, egg, mushroom. I was pretty happy with the All Day Breakfast but should have asked for the egg to be flipped. Coffee was a bit strong but good flavour.
Basically a licensed gourmet sausage shop/ cafe in Greenwich. Short order cook at the front and sausage maker at the back.
Nice.",4
"A banging good time.Truly excellent sausages hand made on the premises. The bacon is wonderful as well. Really friendly staff and efficient service all provided in a bustling shop and café. Very reasonably priced. The gravy with the sausage and mash could have been a little thicker, but don't get us wrong we will be back next time we have cravings for sausages!",4
"Delicious home made sausages to eat in, take away, or buy to cook yourself!A buzzy little place, with good value meals to eat in or takeaway with their home-made sausages the star, but other options are available including vegetarian. There is also a wide range of their sausages and burgers to take home and cook. Service when we went on a Sunday lunchtime was prompt and friendly.",4
"Sausage heavenStaying at ibis wanted to try the brekkie here. 2 Cumberland sausage, bacon, beans egg, mushrooms & tea for £9.40 . Great especially sausages . Nice friendly atmosphere Tip go early it gets busy. Outside seats nice but a bit cold for me...",4
"Yummy yummy sausage!This place was excellent. We went here after a drink at the pub across the way. Staff was knowledgeable and able to find food to accommodate my various food allergies. All sausage made in house, can stay and eat or go buy to cook at home.",4
Fast and FriendlyA lovely quirky little cafe with a local and friendly vibe and super efficient staff. Ideal for a quick breakfast or to buy some tasty sausages!,4
"Lovely breakfastOur first port of call on our day out in Greenwich, only a minute or so walk from Greenwich Park (the corner near the maritime museum). Wife had breakfast plate, kids the kid version of the same and I had the breakfast bap. Sausages very tasty as was the bacon. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food. They also had a very clean customer toilet. Thanks team.",5
"fabulous mealI ordered a classic hot dog and it looked amazing,I took a bite and I nearly jumped out of my chair. It was scrumptious .I’ll definitely come back again.",5
Delicious brunch!We were staying locally but our hotel charged £20 per person for breakfast so we went to Heap’s instead and I’m very glad we did! Their homemade sausages were delicious and the brunch we had set us up for a day of sight-seeing. We didn’t need to book. Staff were very friendly and helpful.,5
"Hearty BreakfastWe stumbled upon this place when staying in Greenwich. The staff are friendly and we’re willing to cook the breakfasts just as we liked it and swapped items around on the set breakfasts so we could have just what we wanted. The food was really good quality too, I had the vegetarian breakfast which is definitely recommend. I’d like to come back and try one of the pies.",5
"Great sausage and it’s dog friendly!Great place and the sausages are amazing as well as the coffee. Definitely recommend this place, we are locals and often come here.",5
"Amazing and efficient customer service!Heaps is a place I often go on a Sunday morning after my walk in the park! I would definitely recommend it to visit! It is a lovely little place, Huge range of sausages but it is not limited to that, it has great breakfast offers and high quality coffee! All the staff are great! In particular Laura always looks after me and is very quick in making sure I don't wait too long for my order! I would like to congratulate this place as the customer service is excellent!",5
"Simply Wow!Oh my. What an amazing breakfast. Double sausage, double bacon and egg (glad I declined the bap). Beautifully cooked, great tasting bacon and sausages. If you are in this part of the world, avoid the boring high street chains and come here for a good feed, friendly people and a fabulous cup of coffee too!",5
Amazing breakfastGreat breakfast! Sausages are amazing! Not much seating but got seated quickly. Cool to see how sausages are made if you want to as well!,5
"YUMMY SAUSAGESMe, my Husband and my Sisters family all enjoy a cheeky visit to Heaps Sausages after a long walk in Greenwich Park and maybe a little shop around the boutiques. It's the perfect place to pick up a sausage bap to eat whilst you walk, or sit in and get a tasty English Breakfast (or my favourite avocado & bacon on toast), or even buy local sausages to take home and cook for dinner. It's a local treasure and we can't get enough !!! Thanks Heaps - pun intended ;)",5
"Great lamb burgerCool little meat shop, also has burger! On the spot, great burger! Unlucky no chips, but rosti done the job somewhat! Extra: if you want to cook it at home for yourself, just buy some patties, 2£(bargaib) and do it.",5
Afternoon TeaI visited this hotel yesterday as it was a birthday present for a good friend. It's not cheap but happy to pay when it is good. However it was dreadful. The sandwiches were made with very thick bread and very little filling. The scones were undercooked. The cakes were ok but not amazing. The service was an absolute disgrace. I urge anyone considering paying £50 per head to look elsewhere. So very disappointed.,1

"Not up to scratchMy mum and I came up to London on the 2nd of September, we decided to visit the Corinthia for a coffee, as we have done in the past and also it was a special treat for her birthday, however on this occasion the service was most disappointing, we sat in the lobby lounge area for at least 20 minutes, finally we got up from our seats to get the attention of one of the 5 waitresses, 5 minutes later she came to serve us, she took our order, our coffee and pastries arrived and were most enjoyable! However after 3 requests my mum still didn't receive her glass of water with her coffee. On the second order of drinks, we got the wrong drink and still no water. We then came to pay, once again a 10 minute wait to attract the attention of a waitress, who promptly forgot the bill, which meant we waited another 10 minutes until we got up and asked another waitress, then received and paid the bill. We did pay the service charge, but on this occasion we definitely did not receive 5* service. The hotel was not busy at all ( about 8 people were there and there were 5 waitresses of what we saw). Most disappointing for the Corinthia.",1
"Disappointingly no longer do cakes to have only pastries.Have been here several times in the past. Always enjoyed a nice tea and slice of cake in the afternoon. Came back after a few months today and they no longer do cakes in the afternoon, just all day pastries. Bizarre decision and won't be returning sadly.",2
"Super slowSandwiches, tea, shampagne etc. all fine but everything seems to take up an enormous amount of time! We've been sitting here for 2,5 hours now and still haven't finished. We've been waiting for the check for the past half hour..

"Too busy and felt crampedWe brought a good friend here today for her birthday.
Having been here a number of times previously, and enjoyed, today was highly disappointing.
We all opted for a champagne afternoon tea, where the glasses were all filled to varying levels. Shoddy.
The service was friendly enough on the rare moments we experienced it, but we were left to pour our own tea (which was not once offered to be refreshed) and I even had to hunt out a staff member for our bill, which was wrong incidentally.
A birthday plate I organised for our friend also failed to arrive.
The duty manager was very sorry -""this never happens here usually"" blah blah blah but it did happen, to us, and we won't we back.",2

"Awful experience - won't be going back.Great expectations from this place considering the hefty price tag. The Service left a lot to be desired. The staff gave a polite indication of being attentive but this was not what was delivered. They should know when tea is going cold or the tea pots are empty, or that there were no fresh tea cups or that there is no milk..the list is endless.

The Hotel itself is breathtaking and the cakes were ""ok"" but as with a lot of these places, not enough emphasis goes on real service. My advice would be if you are going for the atmosphere of the hotel then this is truly lovely... but only go for afternoon tea with eyes wide open. I would not go again",2

"Poor service for a 5 star hotelAfter seeing a review on a blog about the Halloween afternoon tea at the Corinthia hotel, we decided to give it a try for a Sunday lunch. Unfortunately we left with very mixed feelings:

The good:
- Rosé Champagne and Teas were excellent
- Service was almost perfect (see below)
- The hotel itself is magnificent, and the decorations were beautiful
- The ""fancies"" (cakes) were all creative, refined and eye-catching

The bad:
- Sandwiches were not made with good quality ingredients. For example the ham looked like plastic and didn't taste good. In addition, the sandwiches were very small.
- There was only one kind of ""fancy"" per person, which means we had to share them
- The staff mistakenly switched our coats, so we had to go to the cloakroom to find them and get them back

Overall, it was definitely not worth the hefty £135 price for two people. For that price in London, we had an excellent meal at the Michelin-starred restaurant L'Autre Pied.",2
"New Afternoon TeaIf you are looking for the best afternoon tea in London, sadly, I can no longer recommend the Corinthia.

I've had multiple afternoon teas at there but this was my first trip since the ""update"" to the New Afternoon Tea menu.

What the update really means is a a slight reduction in price and a lurch from quality to quantity in regards to the cakes. Previously the cakes were brilliantly crafted with the best flavours in London (better than Mandarin Oriental or the Langham) whereas now I would say that they are lacking in quality of flavour and are unoriginal. For example there was an exotic fruit baba in a glass which was very dull and tasted like bland apples with a bit of cream.

The cakes are now probably on the same level as Claridges (which I do not rate at all either, there's are far too large and uninteresting).

They have changed their approach to serving tea, by not leaving the tea leaves in the pot, this is an improvement because you don't end up with a very strong cup of tea if you're sharing pots.

The sandwiches were nice, if a couple were slightly dry. The scones and strawberry jam combination were very nice. The tonka bean jam sadly lacked in any real flavour.",3
"Not up to usual standardWe have been for afternoon tea many times but this was the first time since it seems to have been re-branded. The setting and staff were still as lovely as ever and the tea, sandwiches and scones were absolutely delicious. Although we did not like the rhubarb and tonka bean jam. But the pastries/cakes were such a disappointment. You now get one pastry each plus cake and marshmallow.However , they seem to have gone for quantity over quality as we did not think that the cakes were a patch on the previous ones,they seemed less ornate and tasted more sweet and sickly. And we did not like all the theatre of bringing the champagne out on a trolley and then the cakes on a trolley. Its such a shame as this was our favourite place for afternoon tea but I am not sure we would come back.",3
"Corinthia LondonVisited in January for afternoon tea with my Boyfriend, as I had reserved a table as a Christmas present. After looking into places in London that served afternoon tea, I decided the Corinthia looked the best and most special, at £55pp, I felt it would be worth it.

When we arrived, we were delighted with the surroundings, the reception had a beautiful table full of gorgeous flowers and the room in which afternoon tea was served had an amazing chandelier, a real showstopper. Our table was situated near the window but we didn't have a view and I was sat facing the lift, which was a shame as I didn't have the opportunity to take in the room itself.

Our waitress was very friendly, took time to explain the menu, asked about any dietary requirements and so on. The choice of tea was impressive, I went for a 'white' tea (the name escapes me!) and my Boyfriend a berry blend, both were really good, especially the pot I had ordered. The waitress did explain tea could be filled up as many times as you liked, however we were never asked and didn't have the opportunity to get a refresh, so my pot was cold by the end of the service and I was too full to have more by the time I had had some sandwiches.

The afternoon tea itself was served on a tower style serving display. There was a good selection of sandwiches, of which you could have more of your favourites. The buns were also flavoured, which was a nice touch. I enjoyed the cucumber, the chicken and the salmon, my Boyfriend liked the crab. There was one sandwich, in a black bun with beef in the middle, the meat was really tough and you couldn't even bite through it, which was weird, I don't know if it was the cut and meant to be like that but it wasn't enjoyable.

Unfortunately, there was a hair in our lemon curd, we brought this to the waitresses attention who was extremely apologetic and brought a fresh pot, although no compliments such as a free drink were offered, which would have been nice and something you'd expect at a place such as the Corinthia.

The scones were fresh and tasty, the lemon curd was amazing (the fresh pot) and the cakes were brilliant, all individually crafted with beautiful finishing touches and flavour combinations that were divine.

Overall, I enjoyed the initial impression, the service (to a degree) and the cakes, but I do believe we were let down in other areas, as explained above and at £55pp, there really should be no complaints.",3

"Eagerly awaited Afternoon Tea that turned out to be a disappointmentAfternoon tea at the Corinthia's Lobby Lounge had been recommended to me by my mother who had recently visited with a friend. She'd raved about the warmth and attentiveness of the staff but unfortunately my friend and I experienced quite the opposite. Our waitress was haughty, abrupt and patronising.

In an effort to focus on the positives (the wonderful ambience, the talented pianist playing in the background, elegant decor, etc), we decided not to complain about her attitude, but it definitely dented our enjoyment.

On leaving the hotel, I forgot something by my chair. I sent an email to the hotel later that night (using the email address that had been handed to me by a member of staff with regards to another query) and I was very disappointed by the lack of response.

We paid over £140 for our festive afternoon tea (including a glass of rose champagne each) and for this price I expected to feel pampered and indulged, not patronised. The Lobby Lounge is undoubtedly a beautiful setting, but unfortunately in my experience, the service left a lot to be desired.",3

"Beautiful lounge but too many drinkers!Having afternoon tea served to me in a hotel lobby, while other hotel guests, who had the right to, walked in and out and behind our table, did not help to enjoy the experience. Having a tiny little round table to eat from for 3 people and great huge chairs was not the most comfortable of seating arrangements.

Having already confirmed verbally over the phone on 3 separate occasions of dietary requests for each guest, it was disappointing that the first thing that was offered as an amuse to my guest, who is vegan, was an item that had gelatine in it. The item was sent back and replaced by a pastry, something which lowered expectations from the start.

Food which was offered was not very inventive, including soggy bread which made me feel sandwiches were made well in advance or stored from the night before, pastries that did not taste fresh and what annoyed us the most was seeing people who had booked for a later sitting being served a completely different set of cakes that looked much more appealing to the eye. To say something positive i would say the teas offered were not bad.

All in all I now wish I had spent my money more wisely with another establishment, especially as this was a special occasion, instead I came away feeling the Corinthia are cleverly utilising the hotel lobby space which would have been overlooked had the food tasted fresh and dietary requests had really been considered.",3

"Lovely setting - had better teaMy friend's and I were looking forward to afternoon tea at the end of July. I avoided the temptation of cake on offer during the week to indulge at Corinthia on the weekend. I had emailed in advance for a sample menu for vegan afternoon tea and I was excited by the prospect of rasberry macarons! It turns out that no such thing was on offer for vegans and this was not the vegan menu...

I had high expectations from walking into the Corinthia lobby. Setting was lovely, table was a little small for 3 people. My first dish was returned as they forgot that it contained gelatin, the sandwiches on offer were finger sandwiches which were good. The desserts however were plain, no creativity or desire to meet the customers needs. It was...breakfast. I got a flapjack with compote and blueberries on top. I also got a coconut yogurt type dessert with granola on top. There was 2 tiny banana bites which were good, followed by a chocolate flat muffin with peanut butter icing. The scones....small and deflated, stogey, tasteless and therefore unfinished. If you want afternoon tea made by chefs who want to cater for all their customers, putting imagination, thought and flavours into your afternoon tea experience go elsewhere. Highly recommend Claridges, Dorchester, The Langham, Lainsborough, LA Suite West (all vegan) & The Ritz who all cater for vegans, vegetarians, gluten free etc.

The rest of my party who were not vegan and asked for traditional afternoon tea also had an average experience as they found desserts not very fresh tasting, dry and not very exciting. Sorry Corinthia, I wish I could have posted a more positive review but the taste buds can't lie.",3

Breakfast meetingI organised a surprise Afternoon Tea for 5 people for a friend's birthday. The service is impeccable and the venue is just stunning.

"EleganceLovely afternoon tea in the Corinthia. Staff attentive to begin with, this dwindled rather as it became busier, however, gorgeous choice of teas and more than ample supply of lovely sweets.

"Fabulous afternoon tea and lovely staffMy daughter and I wanted a special afternoon tea in London and were disappointed that the popular choices like the Ritz and Claridges were full, so glad they were as the Corinthia hotel was amazing. The staff were warm and friendly, nothing too much trouble for them and the area where afternoon tea is served is really special, fabulous flowers arrangements and a piano player. We were offered extra sandwiches, luckily we declined as we would not have had room for the amazing scones and cakes. We could not manage all the cakes and they were boxed up for us to take home. In our opinion this hotel would be hard to beat for an afternoon tea in London.",5
"New Afternoon Tea ... A Little Bit Of Magic ...We visited on a Friday afternoon for the new Afternoon Tea. Staff present and attentive at the desk for a lovely welcome and our reservation was immediately checked and acknowledged with a reserved table ready and waiting. Special requests made online when booking had been noted and were raised by our articulate server. A faultless and impressive start which only confirms the excellent service levels and attention to detail. Not always the case at similar venues.

We have visited each year for Afternoon Tea since the Corinthia opened and also stayed at the hotel previously. We return because it is a wonderful establishment but this year the experience has risen to an entirely new level.

The new Baccarat Crystal Champagne flutes themed with the unbelievably beautiful chandelier are a triumph and the Richard Brendon china is exquisite whilst remaining modern and contemporary. The appreciation of such a quality dining experience cannot be over stated.

Champagne is now served from an antique trolly as are the cakes and pastries. There is now an element of theatre whilst the cakes are described and individually plated in front of your eyes. We were taken on a journey with a flowing story encompassing our childhood tea time memories and engaging us with each individual cake or pastry. It was entertaining, charming, unique and personal. As stated in the title of this review ... a little bit of magic.

As ever the sandwiches were freshly made, replenished and plentiful. The choices of tea is also outstanding. The scones were delivered and presented to the table in another special way which I won't reveal here. It's a simple touch but to great effect.
The Rhubarb and Tonka Bean Jam was delightful and the cakes and pastries, delicious.

Finally, Nigel Stowe was on hand acting as a social host. The added sparkle to the visit. We were from Yorkshire and visiting for the day. Whoever you were or where you were from, Nigel welcomed you warmly and put you at ease. Nigel has what you are unable to teach. The ability to communicate from the heart and on a very personal level. We were made to feel welcome, very special and extremely valued. We will return and not only recommend to others but actively encourage them to visit and experience what we consider to be the best Afternoon Tea in London",5
"Lovely Afternoon Tea!First, we wanted to praise our server from our visit on July 18th. She was so attentive and so kind to us, I feel bad that I forgot her name! As I have worked in the service industry for a number of years, it is always lovely when you see someone treat you that well. We started the afternoon with a bit of a hiccup as the female that greeted us at the front wasn't too pleasant and left a sour taste in our mouthes; but our server definitely made up for this. The female that greeted us had a cranky look on her face and when I came up to her saying, ""hello, I have a reservation at __pm for three people, under the name of Barbara,"" she followed with very rudely, ""do you have a reservation?"" I didn't want to respond in that same manner and upset my mother and sister who were right there, but when they realized how that exchange went over, we agreed that she must have been having a bad day and clearly was not listening to what I said when we walked in.

I had attended with my mother and sister as they were visiting me in the UK for my graduation. When our lovely server found this out, she even came out with an extra cake and 'congratulations' message - this was a great surprise!

When I booked the Afternoon Tea (AT), I was a little concerned that it would not be the same as a traditional AT with the usual three tier plate that is put at the centre of the table. Since this was my mum and sister's first AT, I wanted it to be truly memorable and it definitely was. Each 'course' was served separately, allowing you to take the time with each one and not having the rest sit out there getting stale from the air. This also allowed for our server to frequently check in and see how we were doing, without being intrusive at all.

The sandwiches were amazing! All uniquely delicious; my sister ended up having a second plate! The scones were just as delicious and the desserts were so elegantly presented that we didn't want to eat them and break them apart! I was shocked to see that we could even take the extras home that we did not finish! I cannot forget to add that the tea itself was one of the best that we have ever had. Excellent dairy free options available as well. My sister did not feel left out in any way with her offerings.

Excellent work Corinthia Hotel and The Crystal Moon Lounge! Well worth the cost, especially considering that I have had AT at other venues in the same price range and not impressed at all.",5
"Afternoon tea timeExcellent tea time! All was perfect! Elegant, chic, professional service and with a nice pianist all the time! I was amazed ! Thanks a lot particularly to Nigel Stowe , the manager. He was so nice with me! I will come back!",5
"Superb afternoon teaVisited Friday afternoon for an indulgent birthday afternoon tea with a friend.

The whole experience was superb and thoroughly recommended.

Started with a stunning glass of champagne, served in beautiful heavy lead crystal flutes. The crockery is also delightfully quirky with mirrored cups that reflect the geometric saucer design. Very clever and attractive - especially in the context of ‘the crystal lounge’ theme where everything seems to sparkle. In the sumptuous surroundings of the lounge, we overlooked the grand piano which was played for a time by a wonderful pianist.

The food from beginning to end was excellent. The selection of sweets was particularly wonderful with style and attention to detail that would not be amis in any French patisserie window. The risk with some afternoon teas is that the cakes all feel a bit samey. No such risk here - expertly executed and delicious.

Sandwiches are also worth a mention. The egg mayo and truffle is one of the tastiest afternoon tea sandwiches I’ve ever eaten. Minor criticism, neither me nor my friend eats meat which we advised the staff. Usually, in these types of places you receive some kind of appropriate alternative. In this case we had more of the same three we’d been offered. I’d encourage the hotel to review this and offer alternatives as this was the only slight negative of the experience.

Final mention goes the the serving staff who really were faultless. Every single person we interacted with was friendly, charming and very efficient. The tea sommelier was especially helpful and made some great recommendations.

At £55 per head I think it was great value and this hotel now sits among my favourites. If you’re into afternoon tea, give this place a try. You won’t be disappointed!",5
"Wonderful afternoon tea.A present from family,this was a wonderful experience. The elegant champagne flutes,the stunning exclusive china,the plentiful sandwiches and the warm scones. The pastries and cakes were amazing. We couldn’t eat them all so they were elegantly packed up for us to take away. Wonderful choice of teas. Really pleased to chat with Helios again after meeting him last year.",5

"An idyllic atmosphere for a newly launched sumptuous Afternoon TeaThe Crystal Moon Lounge is the ""heart"" of the splendid Corinthia Hotel.
Its majestic dome houses a unique and grandiose chandelier adorned with 1001 crystal baccarat bubbles.
Whether during the day or at nightfall, the 1001 reflections make it a magical place of breath-taking beauty.
This atrium furnished with classic elegance offers a surprising intimacy where a business meeting is made pleasant as much by the omnipresent refinement as by the incomparable service.
This lobby is very popular for the delightful Traditional Afternoon Tea with its wonderfull choice of delicious pastries, beautiful porcelain, silverware and flawless table cloths for £45 or £55 with a complimentary glass of Champagne Laurent Perrier. This great luxuries of life is accompanied by uplifting melodies from the piano.
The beautiful floral decorations complement the contemporary character of the chandelier. Anyway, a range of exclusive pastries and exquisite floral decorations will be proposed in celebration of The Chelsea Flower Show ( 22nd May- 26th May 2018).
The atrium is surrounded by an interior walkway with elegant leather easy chairs inviting casual and snuggly conversation .

"Easter Afternoon Tea was wonderfulWe had the easter afternoon tea with my partner on a Sunday, sandiches were exquisite and pastries specially made for Easter. Service was perfect, tea selection was very original! We had extra sandwiches and pastries for no charge, and 3 different teas including traditional matcha.",5
"avoid if you have a babyThe most baby unfriendly place i have been to in recent years. Cannot take a pram into the restaurant due to ""fire safety"", no baby changing facilities and you get told off if you dare to make a nappy change due to ""health"" reasons.",1
"Poor attitude and customer serviceThis review saddens me! I was a regular in this chain of eateries, until today. Popped in to grab brunch, asked for a table for two and was told a table would be available in 5 minutes. Waited 8 minutes to be told that because my partner had yet to arrive that I would not be seated.

This complete lack of communication as disregard for the fact that I elderly shocks me. This chain used to care about there clients, sadly the new management has let things slide.

Will take my business elsewhere, currently sitting in Cote, enjoy better quality food, better coffee and service. A different class.

Still it is a shame to see a brand “Balans” become careless re customer service. Disappointed",1
Terrible breakfastThe food was cold and bland. Went here for coffee and brunch. Coffee was sub par and the eggs benedict was cold and the hollandaise was split. We also had a breakfast burrito that was tasteless. Would definitely not recommend for breakfast/brunch.,1
"Not sure what happened...Don't expect any Christmas in your Christmas Lunch.

We travelled here because the 'Sunday Lunch' reviews were so good, and the online Christmas Menu looked very tempting. We arrived last Sunday afternoon to a mostly empty dining room and were handed the plain lunch menu. When asked for the Sunday Lunch or Christmas Lunch menu, the server said ""Oh I'm not sure if this is...let me ask."" She returned 10 minutes later with the Christmas menu and said mysteriously ""Ok we have the chicken. And the turkey."" (there was no chicken on the Christmas menu). I said ""Are you sure?"" She said yes. I said I'd have the terrine starter and... The server interrupted and said ""I think we only have the turkey."" I said ""No, this is the starter. Do you have the terrine as a starter?"" and pointed at it on the menu. She said ""Yes."" I said ""Terrine starter, and Christmas turkey for main course."" My companion ordered the same. The server was really hesitant, sort of flapping around, and I said ""Is that alright?"" and she ran away again 'to check'. Fifteen minutes and one more drink later, she returned to say it was fine. She seemed relieved when we said ""No, forget it, we'll just pay for our drinks and go."" ""You're not ordering food?"" she asked, almost cheerfully. I said ""No, no food, we'll just pay for the drinks."" The service charge was already added to the bill, but I'm not sure we should have paid it. It was the oddest thing. Can't say I'd recommend it, not unless you like being made very confused and having your time wasted.",1
"Poor quality and overpriced foodOrdered a salmon starter and the roast turkey meal. The salmon was poor, came with some weird bread that was NOT fresh and a side order of gherkins for some unknown reason.

The turkey main course (from their christmas menu) was not good quality. The roast potatoes needed far longer in the oven, the gravy was watery, and the bread sauce definitely came out of a packet. There is no beer served on tap so I went for a bottle of wine. £20 and not particularly nice. Despite the excellent reviews on here, I cannot recommend. Maybe I came on a bad day? Maybe the chef was on holiday and they used the ready meal aisle at the local Tesco down the road? Who knows.

Considering the cost of this place, in my experience, it is not worth it one bit.",1
"NO BABY PRAMS ALLOWEDUnfortunately, if your baby is too young to sit in a high chair, you are not able to go to Balans, as they don´t allow baby prams.
They asked us to fold our prams or leave, I explained them the baby was 4 months old (at that age a baby can´t sit in a high chair) and I needed him in the pram, and they said I had to fold the pram or leave (the restaurant was almost empty at that time, only 3 tables with people and they said the pram couldnst be place at any part of the restaurant unless it was folded, and the baby in my arms).
The reason they gave was that they were given strict guidelines from Fire Marshal that they should not have any baby prams in the restaurant which are blocking movement and emergency exits to our customers and staff. The only way they can accommodate with prams is if you fold it and put it a side.",1
"Why Tipping WorksBalans Soho Society was a restaurant that in hindsight my family should not have visited. By far the best aspect of this restaurant was the interior decorating. Overall, the food was adequate but they did run out of their most desirable entree early in the night. One of our entrees came out only after we notified the restaurant's management that it never arrived. I cannot speak for the entire wait staff, but it was obvious that our waiter would have rather been anywhere else. Overall, if you want a lesson in why the United States uses the tipping system... go to Balans Soho Society.",1
"Should have listened to the terrible reviewsVisited here while on a weekend in London after reading the good reviews, should have gone with my gut instinct when they failed to reply to the 2 emails I sent prior to our visit and then fobbed me off when I calld to query this. The starters were mediocre at best and the burgers we ordered as a main were raw in the middle despite asking for them to be cooked medium. The service during our visit was awful, compete lack of attention and still sitting here waiting for the bill 20 minutes after asking for it. The meal was to celebrate our engagement, as explained in the emails and on the phone, and disappointed didn't even come close to how we feel now. Wouldn't return again.",1
Raw Fish !!First of all it's pricy for what is it. Secondly I don't expect my fish and chips to be cold and my fish raw. I sent it back and the waitress (sweet girl) came back to confirm that the chef admitted that he hadn't cooked it properly. Instead of being offered a free meal for the mistake they made which I consumed a bite but thankfully didn't end up suck I had to pay my bill. Disgraceful place.,1
"Unbelievably poorI booked a table this morning for 3.30pm today. I was running five minutes late and called them to inform them and apologise. The call was answered after three minutes and the voice at the other end was cold and unreceptive. We arrived and entered to be sat at the entrance to the toilets In an EMPTY restaurant! I asked for our table of four to be relocated and after some thought the waiter/possibly manager (black shirt!) showed us to the other end of the restaurant and we were told firmly we had to vacate by 5pm which was fine. However, once we were seated a waiter threw a massive strop as he had set the area for a party later this evening and he even smashed a decoration from the Xmas tree which smashed in the table and floor!!!! We were then asked to move back to the table we had vacated and I promptly told them this would not happen and we were leaving!!! Sooooo poor for a place that comes as part of an apparent successful chain????
Disgusted with the way my guests and I were treated!!!!",1
"Poor brunch.Very disappointing. Slow service, mean portions, very very cheap quality smoked salmon, over cooked eggs, aggressively cleared plates. Will not return.",2
"DisappointedWent for a few drinks and lunch, drinks were good but waited an hour for a falafel wrap. Waitress came over after 45 minutes to apologise as she’d forgotten to put it in, but was rather disappointed there was only an apology by way of compensation, for a ridiculously long wait for a wrap, when the waitress came over twice prior to assure me it was on its way and was just a bit wow due to being busy.

Probably wouldn’t go again, nothing amazing, disappointed by the wait.",2
"Oil and mouldWent for brunch here after trying another branch location and have to say was sorely disappointed after what I had experienced last time was quite decent. Here the bacon and breakfast was full of oil. And we were charged extra on the pancakes (a smaller portion than the other balans we tried), for the berries, when we didn’t get charged extra at the other branch! Not only that but half the berries we were given had MOULD on them and were going off and we were still charged for them! Incredulous! Won’t be going back to any of the branches after today’s experience.",2
"My ears hurtI went to balans after walking past and thinking it looked comforting and nice, it was not. The constant smashing of the bell from downstairs and frantic staff rushing around stressed me out, we were sat near the stairs so close to the kitchen I assume and the bell was just horrible. Killed the mood completely. Balans are quite obviously trying to be an alternative place to eat but the decor was just tacky and unnecessary. Service was lovely from the young girls which is where I give my praise. Other than that the food is not that flash and was ruined by the bell. I know some two story places ring a phone to inform staff food is ready, otherwise one ring is surely enough, staff always rushed to it either way. I wasn’t going to write a review but I came back again recently for coffee (which was so over priced) and the bell was going off again ‍♀️ it’s a no from me",2
"Average food and serviceThis is my third visit to Balan's over 6 months. It has been the same menu.
No specials on the menu... would like to see some new items on the menu...

The service is also very slow, staff just keep chatting amongst themselves and we have to try and attract the staff attention.
Ordered tea and asked the lady for milk which didn't arrive for 10 minutes and then had to ask again.

Overall a satisfactory experience",2
"AverageI have visited the restaurant for breakfast, and ordered the smoked salmon. The presentation was average, the taste was good, and the service was fine. Overall the experience was a 6/10.",2
"Avoid the breakfastI came here for breakfast. The head waiter is very much an ""in your face guy"". On arrival he listed off everything from the breakfast menu .. I did not understand a word he said , it was rapid fire. I ordered the baked granola. It was inedible .. A mix of berries .. yoghurt ..granola ..smothered in and built on a foundation of acutely sweetened honey. Absolutely inedible. I picked at the berries .. No one asked me if I had a problem .. The bowl of "" mush"" was taken away ..? The bill was brought. The bill was paid ... If this is breakfast I shudder to think what it's like in the evening .. I don't think I will be back to find out.",2
"Not what i expectedI took my brother & cousin to eat, i had informed them the food is good etc, for i visited the one in Soho. I was disappointed when the menu came, there wasn't much to go by. We just ended up having pancakes and went somewhere else to eat. They were short staffed, even though it wasn't busy. Pancakes took a while to come & when it came it was cold.",2
"If it ain't broke don't fix itUnfortunately it's changed for the worse.
We've been regular guests for years and were very surprised at the change of name and change of decor to a cold, unfriendly ambience.
The menu seems shorter and less interesting. We used to have difficulty choosing because we really wanted everything on the menu. Now it's difficult to find find anything we like in the menu.

Our starter was Avocado and Prawn cocktail but half way through we still hadn't found any trace of avocado although there was plenty of lettuce.
When we queried this the waitress started to explain where the avocado was but she gave up when she realised we weren't buying it. The manager came and removed our dishes explaining that a trainee in the kitchen had forgotten one of the two main ingredients of our dish! They were replaced with the correct dish.
He apologised profusely but didn't offer any compensation in the form of a complimentary coffee or glass of wine.
In any case I wonder if this place is at all related to the previous Balans.
I won't be going back soon but I might try Sopranos next door.",2
"AverageGroup meal after a business meeting. Arrived early for a drink but not allowed to stand at the bar as would disturb another table. Left and went elsewhere and returned later for the meal.

Meal average, presentation on plate poor. Had fish which was over cooked with batter hard. A smear of something called mushy peas and a few chips. Do not drink wine but not offered anything else. Water served which was warm.

Did not take a starter so an hour until my main arrived. Service average.

Would not recommend",2
good service average foodit's a very casual restaurant with a very good service and relaxing decor but the food is nothing exceptional even the signature burger dish is so mediocre!,3
"Overpriced FoodWe origionally came to have the Christmas dinner from the menu, however after realising it would cost over £30 for a basic three course meal, I opted to have the burger instead. The service was excellent to tell the truth, the waiters and waitresses continued to check up on us during the night and made sure our water glass never ran dry, however I'm not sure if it's because we were one of the only tables there on that Friday night... The atmosphere was a bit dead. The burger was okay, nothing spectacular but not horrible either, it definitely was not worth £14 however. I found the chips to be awful, they were ridiculously thick and not crispy at all, it seemed like poorly roasted potatoes rather than chips. Overall the service was excellent and they deserved the tip, but the food and atmosphere let this restaurant down.",3
"Pleasant enoughWe popped in on a cold wet wintry evening and received a warm welcome. The waitress, however, made us feel rushed, and our starters and main courses arrived almost simultaneously. The pasta with crab was nice but not stunning, and the desserts were good. All in all, OK but no better.",3
"Cold foodWent here with some friends having been numerous times, and always been impressed. Sadly on this occasion this wasn’t the case. The food came relatively promptly, but my full English breakfast, as well my friends breakfast (also full English) were both stone cold. We were on a large group and everyone else’s was fine...

We both mentioned it to our waitress who apologetically took it back and returned moments later to say the chef would prepare 2 fresh breakfasts. 3 minutes later what was clearly the same breakfasts only microwaved returned. I couldn’t be bothered to complain again and my friends had all finished by this point.

To rub salt in the wounds we were charged full price (£10) as well as a 12.5% tip. Not impressed and slightly embarrassed having recommended it in the first place.",3
AverageBeen there a couple of times now and the experience has been the same. Food is OK but nothing special. Service is mediocre. A few mistakes made with our order both times and non attentive staff who don't seem to be bothered. Won't be going back again. Could be so much better with more professional waiting staff.,3
"Very limited gluten free optionsAlthough the restaurant is categorised as ""British, European, Gluten free options"", as a coeliac I found the gluten free options to be very limited. There is no specific gluten free menu available to choose from; it is the case of looking at the main menu, deciding which option could be gluten free, asking the waitress if the option is gluten free, and then she goes off to check.
All three of us chose the lamb rump. To make mine gluten free, it was served without the couscous. Unfortunately it was not substituted with anything, so in comparison my plate looked relatively empty.
I asked if I could perhaps have some mashed potato, and was told this could be supplied as an extra - £3.50 in fact.

Not wanting to make a scene in the restaurant, we just paid up. I subsequently provided feedback through the website. The manager did respond that I should not have been charged the extra £3.50, and that on our next visit, we can have a free cocktail.

It will be unlikely that we return to sample the free cocktails.",3
"Service Can KillThe food at Balans Soho Society is varied, creative and well prepared. The Red Curry dishes, for example, were piquant but not too, with plenty of shrimp and/or chicken and vegetables to balance the jasmine. The burgers are succulent. Unfortunately, the place seems to be lacking in waitstaff, and some are not well trained. We were served wine without a tasting (what makes this place immune to a bad bottle?), one of our appetizers showed up late, and the entree after everyone had eaten, and well, we sat there with two of us gone on to dessert for 20 minutes and finally had to flag down the waitstaff to get the check. THIS was a time for ""tipping""--as they do in the US. Waitstaff here seem completely unmotivated to do better. A shame for the cook.",3
"They are stopping the best plates one after the other !It started by the excellent Gyoza that were stopped a year ago, and now the beef salad as well as the cobb one has been replaced by others..
I Tried the salmon one instead of my favorite thai beef one - not tasteful at all .. .so disappointed.
The New chicken one is OK but nothing compared to the Cobb one ... such a shame they are stopping all those fantastic plates.
The brunch is nice. I had the egg royale very nice, pancakes are amazing too !
The service is amazing and the venue really nice but I will definitely go less often there as the quality is not there anymore unfortunately (Except for the brunch)... such a shame..",3
"Reliable BalansYou know what you're getting with Balans. Mid market, easy to eat, familiar favourites. I had lunch here with my niece last week, I ordered the burger she had an all day breakfast. The staff were lovely, it's a solid family friendly atmosphere in a pleasant environment. Sometimes that's all you need.",3
"Very stylish,but a bit over ratedwe came here on a sunday morning ,the place was busy ,staff were very friendly and the menu for brunch/breakfast looked great ,i had a cheese omelette with sauted potatoes which was good ,my wife had poached eggs with avocado and great toast but the eggs were a bit on the uncooked side (runny yolks but runny whites too).great coffee and reasonably priced and would have been perfect if the eggs had another 30 seconds !",3
"Great serviceThe major assett of this lovely restaurant, along with the location on the famed Kensington High Street, is the service.
You have to try it to believe it.
Our glasses were never left empty and we didn’t order any drink, just free tap water.
That explains everything by itself.
The place is lovely, simply but elegant.
We tried their signature dish, the ‘unfamous’ burger and some vegetarian sides and we were happy.
Prices were fair, and there was a nice atmoshere of quiet and relax.
We certainly will go back",4
"Nice brunch!Overall quite satisfied with this cute quirky but stylishly decorated diner (we sat on a table with a tree coming out from the center of it!

Food was overall good quality but the loss of 1 star was down to the overdone and vinegary poached eggs (for the price I expected them to be runny) and the bloody Mary was quite average but overall experience was very nice.",4
"Evening mealWe were recommended to try her by a friend for the amazing burger. I reserved a table thinking it would be necessary on a Saturday night around 5pm - 5:30pm. When we arrived there was one other person, so maybe we were early. We had a drink one of the two days tables outside on the high street. The waitress was very polite and speedy with the menu then the drinks. We then headed inside for the food. I had the burger and it didn’t disappoint. It was big, juicy and full of flavour. My wife chose the crab linguine but she found far too much shell left in the mixture. Overall it was a pleasant experience, not sure we’d return though, because of the shell in the dish and there’s also far more restaurants to choose from.",4
"UNACCEPTABLY OVERPRICEDVery overpriced while serving casual dishes that everyone could make at their home like pasta with kale 13 £!! Two pancakes 🥞 (layers I mean, not portions) 9 £!! Not applying local business discount. After all, delicious with great atmosphere! 😊",4
"Flat White best in townJust about the best flat white coffee in London. Very creamy and to all intents and purposes it is a Cappuccino italian style. I know because I live in Italy.
Good breakfast food and very friendly staff. The decor is mainly wood and adds some charm and atmosphere with ample seating even for larger parties.",4
"Brunch & CocktailsSo so happy this place is still up and running after so many years.

We used To hit this restaurant quite hard a few years ago for naughty brunches as the staff were raucous and fun.

Coming here the other Day with my Mother and im pleased to say nothing has changed!

The food came out fast, tasty, the waiter was friendly ( maybe a little flirty with my mum! ) little expensive after so many cocktails but we loved it so worth pretty much every penny.",4
"BreakfastReally enjoyed breakfast at this cozy restaurant, great atmosphere and really friendly staff. Breakfast should be easy and simple but that’s not always what one finds, however the food at Balans was great so much so we skipped our hotel breakfast and ate there on consecutive days. A real treat!",4
"AppropriateOur waiter was amazing, shame I didn't get his name. Food more than correct, me and my sister were happily surprised. I would come back anytime, for any occasion.",4
"Much better than a burgerNot much of interest to choose from in this area nowadays, apart from the usual tedious restaurant chains, so this upmarket brunch cafe was a welcome change.

Very good quality, very fresh, and a well prepared Eggs Benedict was just the job for me. Pancake & bacon stack with maple syrup silenced a teenager (in a good way!). The coffee (Americano) was too bitter for my taste - I prefer a smoother brew. Smart, polite staff, and free iced water regularly brought round was a nice touch.

I’m old school, so happily have a bacon sarnie and a mug of tea, but if this is the Kensington version, it’ll do for me.",4
"Fresh and tasty red currySo I’ve been staying overnight in London on a regular basis for a number of years and usually in the same area. Always walked past Balans but tried it tonight and pleased I did.

A mix of lots of people around the bar and seating and fairly busy even for an early evening.

Quickly seated and glass of reasonably good wine. Picked the prawn red curry which was very fresh and tasty with a nice kick.

As usual in London it’s more expensive and the all too regular 12.5% service added to the bill. But the service was good and attentive.

Will certainly return",4
"I love this restaurant!I found this restaurant on Kensington High Street because the breakfast at my hotel was awful. Upon walking in I was greeted by a very cheerful girl. When I sat down I noticed everyone that worked there seemed quite cheerful and happy. Great atmosphere straight away! The young lady brought me the menu and water right away . I so appreciated the water as it was very hot outside and she must have seen I needed it. I ordered fresh squeezed orange juice, scrambled eggs, bacon and balans potatoes. Toast was complimentary and so I was very full when I finished my meal. Did I say I finished my meal? Yes I finished every last morsel of it. It was hands down the best breakfast I have ever eaten in my life. Seriously! The best breakfast I have ever eaten! The scrambled eggs have a flavour in them that I cannot identify but they were heaven in my mouth. The bacon was top quality and cooked to perfection. The Balans potatoes: fabulous. I ate every one of them. They are gorgeous! The toast : Two freshly baked slices of bread toasted to perfection. Lovely dairy butter. The orange juice was fresh and cold and refreshing.
I enjoyed my breakfast so much I decided to go back and try them for lunch the next day. I had the chicken and bacon cobb. Lovely. I especially liked the ranch dressing. It was a perfect lunch. Light , refreshing and not too filling. I was very happy.
I waited a few days and went for dinner. I thought well these guys made the best breakfast ever; a refreshing and delicious lunch... let's see what they can do for dinner.
I ordered a green salad and the Cornish clam linguini. The green salad was nice. To be honest it was a green salad, nothing special. But I didn't expect it to be as I only ordered it as an aside because I try to eat salad green with every dinner not because I especially like green salads. I had asked the waiter ( who was a very pleasant nice young man) to have the chef be light on the chilli and I am happy to say the chef was light on the chilli. The linguini was cooked perfectly. The crab was lovely and not mushy as I have found in other restaurants when mixed with the sauce and pasta.
I love this restaurant and cannot praise it enough from the friendly staff, warm atmosphere and good food. But mostly the one thing very noticeable about this restaurant are the chefs know how to cook. Bravo !",5
FantasticVisited for breakfast and dinner at night. Great atmosphere and excellent food served by friendly and informed staff A special mention must go to Dave the waiter from RSA who made our evening memorable.,5
Fantastic!Came here for breakfast when staying in a nearby hotel where breakfast charges were exorbitant. Didn't look anything special from the outside but when we went in we were made very welcome and were looked after very well. It was a boiling hot day even though it was early and I loved the fact that we were given water straight away and it was constantly topped up. The food was delicious and very filling. The service was excellent. A great start to the day!,5
Great atmosphere and foodWe wanted English food with flavor and a twist and were happy we found Balans Soho Soc. The atmosphere and wait staff made for a nice end to a long day around town.,5
Brunch and cocktailsMid morning brunch to start off a wonderful wedding shopping trip with my daughters and friends. Fantastic food and cocktails - friendly and attentive staff,5
Lovely food. Great serviceI stumbled upon this place while looking for an old English pub on the Kensington High street and glad I did. I had the high society Benedict with lobster and avocado and it was divine.,5
"Gem on the High StreetHad a nice dinner on a Saturday night. Were able to get seated without a reservation. The wait staff was attentive, pleasant and professional. The food was great and the ambiance relaxing. I will return.",5
"AmazingCame here with colleagues last night, really attentive staff, very friendly. I had the red curry which was amazing! If I could have licked the bowl I would have!",5
"Excellent ServiceWe come to Balans regularly - mostly for breakfast and the service is always excellent! The waiters are attentive: as soon as you sit down, they immediately serve you a glass of water and refill it throughout your meal. There are a variety of dishes on the menu and the food is well prepared and delicious. My personal favourite is the Egg Benedict with salmon, though the sourdough bread is nice too! Good atmosphere and pleasant background music.",5
"Delicious and great service!My dad and I came here for dinner last week as we saw the menu outside and it looked good. It was fantastic! There was a great mix of food on the menu - I had the lamb with garlic risotto which was brilliant, and my dad had the cod which was equally lovely. The service was really great and we felt very welcome. Generous portions, also the Manchego and serrano croquettes were gorgeous. The cocktails were fab (I had the champagne and raspberry one as a treat!) and our evening was lovely. We took a loyalty card and can’t wait to come back! Thanks so much for a fab dinner!",5
Terrible customer serviceApparently restaurant is closing its kitchen at 5pm. I arrived with my family at 4.55pm at have been told that we would not be served... they did not offer any quick meal even for take away and been very unpleasant. I thought restaurant is a business and should be customer friendly. You should change your opening hours to 5pm not 6pm on your website and google.,1
"If you are not Polish, you are not welcome!Dear Madam,

We are very sorry for the situation that occurred,we hope that we can resolve this issue and therefore we have messaged you privately in hope that we can fix the issue.

Kind Regards,
Sowa Restaurant",1
"Waiting timeThe place is nice and cakes are awesome, but the atmosphere is below any expectations. I have been to the place three times and every time I felt that I am not welcome because I am not Polish. Every time other customers (Polish) insistently spoke to me in Polish and when I replied in English they looked at me with antipathy, with a silent question ''What are you doing here???"". Sorry we are not in Poland, and even in Poland that kind of behavior is unacceptable. Also, Polish is not international language, why do they expect other people to know it?
Last time we went for a dessert (four people) all different nations and race. Waitresses just ignored us. People who spoke Polish arrived after us, but they were served first! That was total disrespect. We just left the place... left for good...",1
"Never sgainWe have reported your speech as a hateful review, which has racial undertones. I hope that in the future you will not treat other people or businesses in this way due to their nationality or place of origin. Kind regards. Sowa Restaurant - owner . Krzysztof Kacprzak",1
"Not that goodThe food was nice, but I think that the value of the portion was too little and too expensive, and I think than the meat very fat. And the service is not good, the waitress disappeared for a long time.

We went there because we saw some good reviews, but yes the service is not good.",2
"Waitresses are not botheredWe were looking a while for place to eat good polish food. We chose Sowa based on fact that most likely they are connected with Sowa brand which we know from Poland and we can highly recommend it. They are associated with them but what a disappointment. We've ordered two different plates: pork knuckle and pork cutlet. Cutlet was fine in size but no seasoning at all. Knuckle was a good size but 80% was bone, 5% fat and just a bit of meat. Same - no seasoning at all. Knowing precisely what is roasted pork knuckle we were really disappointed. After we finished our plates, waitress didn't even bother to ask us if we want any dessert (especially they have door connecting them with patisserie next door!). After 20 minutes of endless waiting I've just ask for the bill. Another surprise came when paying for food. When we came I've asked if we can pay by any card and it was confirmed that yes. Surprisingly when it get to payment, I've been told that cards yes but not Amex and ideally not credit cards. A bit of a bummer as Amex becoming more and more popular. We left with a really sour taste in our minds. Considering that I'm polish and my wife is Mexican so we normally talk in English or Spanish, I got to say, that previous review - which apparently has been marked by owner as racist comment - its truth. Tables where are only polish people were attended differently.
To summarise: you better off to any other polish restaurant which is run by local guy, who's actually cares about his business. This place? Loads of money pumped in, but failing at home warmth and good traditional polish touch.",2
"Food great, customer service not so greatHaving been there several times to eat I have always enjoyed the food and the service has been adequate. When I booked a function for 14 the communication between the manageress/owner was non existent. It was virtually impossible to get hold of her, nothing was received by email from her despite assurances and promises that it would be, etc, etc. Then after I cancelled had several phone calls from different people at the restaurant assking about various things. Terribly disjointed management,",2
"Decent work mealNice little place in Ealing, very cultural and well decorated. Dim lights make for a chilled evening. Wish there were more options on the menu and more soft drinks. Food was food though and VERY strong margarita cocktails! Only bad thing was that there was a hair in my colleagues dinner!",3
"Polish ""pierogi"" and cakesPolish pierogi and cakes are really good and tasty. We have visited on Saturday evening and this restaurant was busy. Service was slow, however friendly. There is poor selection of wines and even poorest selection of beers. Only one or two polish beers in bottles, no draughts.
The game dishes some of us had were dry however nicely presented. There was 12.5% service charge added to the bill, which was beyond our appreciation. restaurant do not accept AMEX CC cards.",3
Good food just...Friday dinner with my friend (2 skinny women) we order some fish with staff recommendation. Food wasn’t bad just portion was to small for us and no salt or lemon. Little disappointed. Menu a pit poor. No choice. I’m not big fan or cream soup so leaving restaurant hungry. And price 23£ wasn’t brilliant as well. Staff very friendly,3
"Pricey Polish RestaurantI love the dumplings and something had a crave to go and eat the biggest portion they have! Apart from that, the restaurant is very expensive. The menu is very sophisticated and prices are high. For the same price you can eat locally and probably you will get bigger portions.",3
"Standard Has SlippedI've eaten here a few times and each time it has been very enjoyable apart from two weeks ago when lunch was pretty bland and uninspiring. We had the chicken and fish main which we had both had before. Both dishes had changed and didn't taste of much at all, the chicken and fish was dry and over cooked. We will probably give it another try but its a shame the standards appear to have dropped.",3
"Sowa Patisserie = TOPI came her with a friend that loves this place very much and now I know why! Nice and comfortable place, good prices and multiple choice of chocolates and cakes. We ordered two cappuccino and chocolates (muesli, champagne,cocoa and orange): everything was delicious. Recommended!",4
"Cakes to die for - lovely surpriseSo glad we wondered in. Lovely atmosphere and good service. Credit where credit is due. Lovely cakes and a decent offering of desserts considering we just wondered off the streets. We fancied something sweet and wanted something new. Sowa delivered this. We will definitely be coming back for the cakes. Coffee was ok and unfortunately lacked barista style but the cakes made up for it. Everything tasted fresh and was prepared wonderfully- well done and keep up the good work.

Please note 50% of the deserts do have alcohol in them so make sure you do ask. And please remember “cheesecake” here is very different but good in many ways.",4
"Good food, reasonable pricesI ate here recently with a friend on a Saturday evening. There's a reasonable selection of Polish dishes on the menu (not as varied as at some other eastern European restaurants, though). There's also a good choice of Czech beers, but the vodka selection was relatively limited. The service was quite good - food was served quickly, but beer orders seemed to take longer than other drinks. Worth a visit if you're in the area, but not if travelling from further afield.",4
"Just amazingI always buy birthday cakes there but it was the first time I had a lunch there. And it was so good that the day after I went there with my family for a dinner!
Everything 1st class - the service, quality and taste of the food.
Also very good prices and big portion.",4
"Polish lunchWe have had the set lunch menu, starting with nice, hot cabbage soup. After that I have had pierogi, boiled dumplings stuffed with cabbage, mince meat and cheese and my friend nice presented pork (two pieces of rolled pork steak stuffed with potatoes?) with some vegetables.
The food seems fresh made, perhaps a little too salty. The free fruit juice was undrinkable. The alternative, hot hot water and two slides of lemons was much better!",4
"Very goodAmazing cake and coffee, as well as traditional polish dishes. I will definitely come back If you like pierogi and dumplings or were thinking about trying it, this the place to go. Also they do a variety of main meals and good puddings, plus polish beer.",4
"Dinner with DadThank you for your review, we are very happy to hear you enjoyed a variety of our products from the restaurant as well as the patisserie, we hope to see you again soon, :)
Sowa Restaurant Team",4
Great place for an afternoon teaA really nice evening & meal. We were new to Polish food and had a great meal. The food was freshly prepared and very tasty. The service was friendly and helpful. Great value as well.,4
"Food always amazing!James, We are glad to have provided you with a positive time for your first experience for Polish food, we hope that you come back soon to try more of the meals available on our menu,:D Sowa Restaurant Team",4
Lunch menu was good but no longer serveThere were 10 of us looking for a place to have afternoon tea with snacks so we came across this restaurant which has its own bakery. All their cakes and desserts looked very appealing so we decided to go and the staff were very accommodating to give us all one long table. All the drinks we ordered were tasty specially their fresh juices and latte. Some of us chose desserts and they were tasty the only thing disappointing was the trio cheese cake all three variety tasted stale which I did not enjoy. However I would go back again to try some of their savoury food however they don’t seem to be catering Halal food.,4
"Lovely restaurant, food and serversReally excellent Polish restaurant with an interesting but traditional menu. The service was great with the lovely waitress patiently explaining the various dishes. A real gem that local people should support
They should run a competition as to how many pierogi's does the lady in the glass kitchen make in a day!",5
"Great food, resalable price.Came at lunch time, having a very easy lunch menu offer. Authentic, tasty food and nice place. A little slow service, but after all our waitress was lovely and excellent.",5
"Beautiful FoodI was interested in going to Sowa mainly because I've been to Poland a few times and loved the food. What a lovely restaurant, our waitress Ania was brilliant. I wasn't really sure what wine to have so Ania gave me a couple to taste, the red Portuguese was lovely. Everything about Sowa is so nice.",5
"Superb Polish RestaurantI prefer my perogi fried to boiled and the starter with beef cheek was excellent, the old style Polish beef roulade with dumplings and beetroot was even better - well done to everyone at Sowa for a lovely evening.",5
Favorite restaurant in EalingI am from US working in UK for a few months and living in Ealing. My wife and I stumbled upon Sowa and it is a real jewel. The food is authentic Polish starting with the Beef Roulade which is fantastic. After that try everything else on the menu. Can't go wrong. Try the Pierogies as an appetizer which are hand made by a lady behind a window at the back of the restaurant.Whenever we have friends visit we take them there first. Already know some of the staff (all Polish) and they are very nice and friendly. Must try if you are anywhere near Ealing!,5
"AmazingAmazing food worth every penny,great service I will be recomend this place to everyone.The best dessert which I ever had to be honest👍",5
Probably the best lunch in EalingBest find in Ealing. Weekly lunch menus are excellent! Tasty and really nicely presented. Staff is very friendly. Prices are not high. I was never dissapointed. Highly recommended!,5
"Lovely findWe stayed a couple of days in Ealing and just wandered through the town one afternoon looking for ideas for an evening meal. We walked past this restaurant and had a look at the menu outside, and thought it looked nice and a bit different. A quick check on reviews of it backed this up so we booked ourselves, and so glad we did.
The staff are really friendly and the food was lovely. For desserts I went into the adjoining patisserie and was totally spoilt for choice.
Great food, great service, nice venue. Would happily re-visit",5
"St John's pie to die forMy wife and I came in for a refreshing and delicately flavoured iced Earl Grey tea and chose to share a piece of the Stuff John's pie which is a mix of fruit, custard and crumble. It was light and not too sweet.",5
The bakery is the bombWe did not eat at the restaurant but have gotten delicious pastries from the bakery. Be prepared to order. The staff is curt and ready to serve you. We are American and were unfamiliar with some items and asked questions. They sort of seemed annoyed with that. We will be back anyway.,5
Long Queue/Mixed QualityA visit to the new larger Frith St. premises which is spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately there was only one member of staff serving and one making coffee causing a long queue. Other staff present but not serving. The salad was very fresh and delicious as was a cheese and pickle sandwich with some tasty pickle. Unfortunately the almond croissant that was a little hard and was certainly not fresh downgraded an already mixed experience. Are Pret A Manger finally losing it?,1
"yeah..but still...it is just a sandwichI can't believe this is the first cheap eat in Marylebone. I had a salmon sandwich, that should have been with dill inside. No trace of that! If you make a sandwich the only thing you need to do is to remember the ingridients! The product are fresh more than the averege London food, and the bread is not so bad. But still...it's just a sandwich, please at least make it right.",1
Bacon in vegetable sandwichThis is a really late comment but I need to say that last year around this time I bought a sandwich which was suitable for vegetarians but it had 'bacon' in it.,1
"Bad espresso, very bitterJust went for a single espresso and have been very disappointed. It was very bitter. From a special coffee bar I expect better quality. No reco from my side",1
"Worse than terrible.Nowadays there is no excuse not to serve gluten free food. If your gluten free like me then there is basically nothing in this place that you can eat. They serve plentiful vegan and vegetarian options though. People who are vegan or vegetarian choose to be this way, coeliacs do not choose to have a serious allergy. In my opinion they should get rid of some (not all) of the vegetarian/vegan options on their shelves and make room for those of us who don't have a choice but to eat gluten free.",1
"Bad coffee, don't bother with itUsually Pret a Manger is excellent, I don't know what happened but their coffee was undrinkable. They have gone down since they first started business. Very disappointing",1
Very DistastefulThis relates to Pret A Manger in Wood Green and in general. We found a human hair of approx 5 inches inside a LoveBar. The cost was refunded when I showed it to a member of staff. The staff were very helpful in all ways and my rating is not about them it's about the disgusting hygiene of the items they sell,1
"Warm Summer Saturday-No Frozen Drinks!Stopped by to get one of the plainly advertised Frozen Drinks on a hot Saturday afternoon, just to be told they had none of the frozen drinks. One would've thought that on a day such as this, Pret a Manger would be willing to help potential customers cool off a bit!",1
"Get fresh fruit please!!!!Just had a nice salad at Pret with family and friends but when it having fresh apples it was terrible!!!!! And this is not the first time I've experienced disgusting apples so get it is very disappointing, please get some fresh apples for your customers, we can tell the difference!!!!! Yours are sour and you charge 80p which is disgusting! Very disappointing with this. Won't be back for a while.",1
Bond Street Station leaves this one disappointing .What s surprise! This is not up to standard. It is located in the ghetto area of an area known as Bond Street Station. There selection is not the same as in the many other fine locations in the city. There are no bathroom facilities in this entire area selling food to the general public to be consumed on site. Super ghetto. Cross the street to St. Christophers square better restarants and adequate facilities for diners are provided. Folks at Bond St are eating and probably urinating on the sidewalk with their lack of proper facilities.,1
Ripping Hong Kong people off!Bought two soups in Hong Kong Pret. More than £3.5 each and the size is ridiculously small! This is shameful!,2
"Shameful and obviousIts a beautiful hot afteroon. My friend and I stopped.by pret for some refeshment and sat outside for almost 2 hours.
We've endured the loud mouth staff arguing outside..ok so it's hot. But most transparently..male staff member deliberately choose not to clear our table
despite the 3 visits we made to refill and purchase your beverages. The small petit guy who served was polite and a credit to.pret..see for youself",2
Less vegan more gluten free please!!!Too many vegan options and not enough gluten free options. Vegans choose to be vegan. I do not choose to be gluten free. A piece of meat won’t hurt a vegan. However gluten could really do some damage to people like me. I think you should be concentrating less on vegans and more upon actual food allergies and intolerances.,2
Over crowded.We stopped for a quick bite to eat. Very chaotic atmosphere. Very good staff at the til but the eating areas were crazy. So many people in there that were on thier lunch breaks from work bringing thier own lunches and drinks and just taking up all the seating. We had to wait a while to find a table. Huge queue for toilets also. Better facilities would increase customer satisfaction.,2
Quick in and out place but tasteless foodThis seems like a great place to get ready food but be warned that the sandwiches a really tasteless. They are safe and filling but at least the chicken ones are really bland. Go to m&s and have a chicken and avocado instead.,2
"OK until you need a customer toiletI went in here for a coffee and a snack accepting that it would cost rather more than the adjacent McDonald's. After our drink and snack with which all was fine I looked around for a sign to a customer toilet and failed to see one. I found a member of staff to ask - it was obvious that he was not a native English speaker. He gave me a garbled account and I asked him to repeat it. He said that their toilets had rubbish in front of them and so had to be locked. He then continued in very rapid English some thing which again I had to ask him to repeat. No doubt thinking himself very clever he spoke insultingly slowly "" Cross--the--road--and--use -- the-- toilets--at --McDonald's"". From an employee of an establishment that thinks it is so superior to McDonald's and charges so much more this is an incredible thing to tell a customer. If I'd wanted to use McDonald's (normally excellent) toilets I'd have given them my custom.",2
"Oldest Trick in the BookI have been using Pret for years but it is a shame some successful businesses appear to get arrogant or greedy at a certain point. Easiest way to make more money is to keep prices the same but reduce the content. The ever diminishing cadbury's cream example being an example. Now it has happened to Pret's baguettes. Not only are they smaller but they are inconsistent in their fillings which vary hugely in generosity. This isn't a reactionary review as I have been monitoring this for some time. Today's lunch was a chicken and bacon baguette, A dollop of chicken with a slither and a bit of bacon kind of stuck on the side almost looking like it is trying to hide the contents with at least an inch each end with no filling at all on one of those shrinking baguettes.

When I complained one time the manager agreed and made me one himself but I can't be doing that every time.

It's a shame I used to like Pret. Still tastes ok but consistency is lacking and doesn't feel like value for money anymore - off to subway.",2
"Hoped for something elseThere are various Pret-a- Mangers in London. So my curiosity pulled me towards it. But lo! What do I see... Nothing but variety of salads n fruits . Nothing great.
We were really hungry, but had to leave as we really didn't find anything that would have relieved our taste buds.",2
"Tried mango juice, and it was not mangoTried mango juice to beat the heat of London in Aug '18, the drink was not soo cold + the taste was not even close to mango. I ended up leaving the drink more than half as it was not tasty or even cold.",3
Smoked salmonSmoked salmon And veggie juice Was my snack meal for mid day Service good- self service Prices moderate,3
"Too busy!We came in for a quick bite at lunch time. The place was busy, very busy. The selection of food, as usual for this chain, was very good and service came with a smile. The main criticism was that there wasn't enough seating space and people had to stand and eat.",3
"Dependably ok.There everywhere in London ( & branches elsewhere ), I've been in many of & though their not mind blowing or selling anything that's wow, they are, like say Premier inn or McDonalds reassuring dependable. Food choice ( think wraps, sandwich's, salads ) & quality good, surrounding's ok & prices just this side of reasonable. One gripe, they do a nice line in breakfast brioche's, but from my experience, there never on sale when 1st open & it's always more 10 or 11 when available, why, it's a breakfast item ? Also & it's noticeable, staff in any branch never very personable - that though, a management issue & I'd have thought an easy, cost free fix.",3
"Good prepackaged casual at fair cost▪️Location: Besides the reviewed location, numerous in London. ▪️Dining area: Takeout counters. ▪️Food: Good, mainly prepackaged quality and healthy choices. ▪️Cost: Fair. ▪️Service: Friendly, positive, patient. ▪️Previous visits: More than 10 for the brand. ▪️Recommend? Yes",3
very busy. the cashiers were very slow and getting help was very hard. very busy spot. the lines took to long,3
"Like any fast food restaurantAfter all Pret A Manger is like any fast food restaurant chain. Organic food chain.
Coffee is good and the selection are broad.
The baguette, cookies and drink variety are good.
Feels like there is a Pret at any corner in London.
Staffs friedlyness differs from restaurant to restaurant.
Restaurant cleanness at the same level as at other fast food chains. There's a lot to improve.",3
"Stopped for LunchI grabbed a ham and cheese sandwich and they put so very much pepper on it. It was difficult to stomach. The croissants are very good, but if you do not like pepper I would not recommend the sandwiches.",3
Budget-Friendly Comfort FoodLove the soups and rice box. Very helpful when you need quick healthy bites. Lots of workers dine in for lunch. Service and price are also worth it.,3
Busy busythey can really manage the people through this site. I was about tenth in the queue and within a minute I was at the front My only critisim is that there is nothing ew as in inventive recipes. Same stuff everyday,3
Easy eatingYou find a Pret on almost every corner in London. They serve plenty of sandwiches in any variety. Good soups an fresh fruits. Uncomplicated dinning wherever you want for moderate prices.,4
Very good Food and serviceVery good Food and service Had my favorite Smoked Salmon With Green service very good prices moderate staff friendly nice location,4
"Good veg options at a budgetIf u are a vegetarian and looking for wholesome food on a budget in London .. head to one of the Prets spread all over the city .. the carrot and berry smoothie are highly recommended . The coffee also very good .. and the sandwiches like egg and mayo , Italian pesto very filling and good . It’s healthy wholesome food on a budget ... so highly recommended",4
"Busy but fresh, healthy foodI love this place, they serve pretty healthy fresh food with lots of options for vegetarians including sandwiches, salads and wraps. I also recommend the almond croissants (as long as you buy them in the morning by mid afternoon they are rather dry (unsurprisingly) since they have got aired all day..",4
"Tasty coffee, food, and good atmosphereI love Pret a Manger. This one is a particular favourite, it's right across of the Marble Arch at Hyde Park. There's a neat loft area you can go up and sit in. The vegetarian sandwiches are rather nice.",4
"Fresh, and good choicesExcellent choice for health conscious travelers. Pre-made salads and sandwich’s with several drink options...reasonably priced and located everywhere.",4
"Quick and easy food on the goEvery street has at least one Pret A Manger. Quite a wide selection of ready to eat sandwiches, wraps, hot soups and other cold sandwiches, drinks etc. There is also good selection for GF, Vegan etc. If you are in a rush and want to grab some good, fresh food, this is a great choice.",4
"A blessing for workers and tourists on the go.A local introduced me to the ""Pret"" near St. Paul's, and I have been carrying a list of Pret locations in London ever since. No need for an expensive, time-consuming sit-down lunch. Stop in for a hot or cold drink, prepackaged sandwich, a pastry. Sit at a table for a few minutes or take it to go. You might need a list of locations, too.",4
"Nice food, nice priceFreshly prepared on site, good quality and reasonable price. Good place to stop off when in and around central London...or indeed anywhere",4
Quick and HealthyQuick and healthy food on the go. Normally you have to wait in the line for order. But the available options are very good also for vegetarian and vegans,4
"Varied foodThey were all over London and you might think, gosh, it is like McD's, but the food was very good and consistent. The prices were good too!",5
Quick and Lots t choose from!This is a state for us each time we visit London. A great selection of quick bites and reasonably priced.,5
"best choicefor morning coffee or tea. some sandwiches, wraps, cereal or a juice. try the salads and the soups. there are more than 150 outlets in london. best value for money for some food on the go. our favourite was the outlet at tower hill.",5
"Healthy fast foodYou can’t beat pret for good quality, healthy food speedily! My family are devotees to the soup and have yet to try a flavour we don’t all love! Today’s vegetable ravine was no exception!",5
"Always TastyI wish we had this chain in Canada! The food is always fresh. From egg salad sandwich, to avocado salad, to hot chicken wrap; they never disappoint. And the prices are refreshingly affordable. Just be prepared for a crush of people in this take-away restaurant.",5
Really impressedWe don’t have this chain in Ireland but I wish we did. Really healthy options and mostly organic which is a big plus. Was in a lot of branches of this brand around London and it doesn’t disappoint whether it be for breakfast or lunch or a quick snack. I highly recommend it. Would love to see them expand to Ireland.,5
"Can you please open in Australia?I know for most UK people a Pret is a Dom a dozen but for me, a lowly Aussie traveller who was dying for some fresh veg and healthy meals after eating out for all meals everyday this establishment is a god send!!!!

I’ve tried both the hot and cold dishes and have nothing but positive things to say about them! The coffee leaves much to be desired but the drinks, salads and sandwiches are reasonably priced, fresh and convenient.

Please open in Brisbane!!! We need this in Aus! I’ll even start it for u!!!",5
"Delicious diet foodA diet food has never been delicious before. Daily prepared diferrent kinds of delicious soups, wraps and salads. Along my two weeks trip never gain weight and lost my appetite.",5
"Quick service & Quality fresh foodThis food chain is excellent value for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you are on the move. There is seating available too and adequate room for pram or wheelchair access. I would recommend finding one of these as you travel through the UK you will be rewarded with fresh ingredients and healthy alternatives. Adequate vegetarian and some vegan options available too.",5
"Love Love Love the salads!!We were in London for six days and I think we ate at the Pret A Manger around the corner from our rental flat at least once a day, either for a quick bite at breakfast or one of their outstanding salads at lunch. I'm still dreaming about the tomato, mozzarella and avocado salad, so fresh and loved the dressing. I wish we had chains like this in the US with healthy fresh foods! The chicken pesto salad was equally delicious!",5
"fast service average breakfastfast service, busy location, good price for value, lots of options but very average breakfast or sandwiches, nothing exceptional",3
"Very regular breakfastWent there for breakfast based on all of the stunning advices posted on trip advisor. This is good price for value but far from being an astonishing breakfast as comments are saying: thick not so tender bacon, regular sausage, regular eggs, regular toast, regular scramble eggs, ...

Good and efficient service, good place for a good regular breakfast but certainly not the best breakfast of London",3
Great little cafeWhat a find. Fantastic breakfast and great staff. Tea comes in a proper mug. Very close to Shaftesbury theatre,3
"Breakfast on the go....Grabbed a bacon roll from here on my way in to work, service was friendly but they took far too long to make a bacon roll. The girls in front of me left as they had been waiting so long! My bacon roll was nice enough but bacon wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. But after waiting so long I wasn't going to wait any longer!",3
"Good, but ...Saw this on way to British Museum, and went back after seeing the exhibition. Agree with all the reviews, friendly, busy, straightforward menu, good sized portions, although as one reviewer said, cutlery good do with a better wash. But - I tried to go to the toilet, which was down some very steep and narrow stairs and had to walk through a fairly greasy smelling kitchen to access the not very clean toilet, which I chose not to use. The stairs and kitchen area looked as if they could do with a good sweep and clean, not sure therefore if I'd go again.",3
"Good for Lunchspent like a fiver for Lunch here. portions could be bigger. cutlery could be cleaner also. Service Staff were friendly, food took 5 mins.",3
BreakfastThis is a busy little place which was an ideal breakfast stop as we were staying in Drury Lane. Bacon and sausage sandwiches went down well with tea and coffee to set us up on a busy day ahead. Worth stopping by for.,4
"Great service and delicious paniniItalian style of welcoming inside thd store and way of service. We had two panini, one vegetarian (mozzarella tomato rucola) and one with parma ham. Prices affordable and the vegetarian panini was very good. The parma ham was slightly not as fresh as expected but still the overall taste of the sandwich was good. We had them toasted and take away. There is an option of sitting inside and outside too.",4
Fab little placeVisited today to grab lunch before the theatre. Reasonable prices and nice food. Friendly and polite staff. Be prepared to wait though as it is a relatively small place that looks to always be busy. Good selection of food and some amazing looking pastries!,4
"Good FoodNice place to get a take away lunch, quick to serve, reasonable London prices, and a wide variety of choice on the menu. Friendly staff too!",4
"So many optionsThis popular, old school cafe serves a bit of everything - pasta, salads, jacket potatoes, sandwiches, breakfasts... If you're hungry, the portions are very generous. Great location, lovely service. Only 1 thing - it's very small inside. Suggest avoiding during midweek lunch hours.",4
"""Continental""---or Typically British?If you want to get an early start and be at the door of the British Museum when it opens at 10 a.m.,""Franx"" is a good place to fuel up before tackling the huge museum. The cafe's only a few minutes' walk from the museum.
I was looking for a place in the area to have breakfast, and came across it by accident. I was really lucky: my Full English Breakfast with a cup of tea was really good. It was one of four variations (including a veggie option), and was a good price at between 5.50 and 6.50 pounds, with sides between 80p and 1.20 pounds. These prices are hard to find in such a touristy area as this.
What I enjoyed as much as the food was the atmosphere. The cafe is tiny and narrow, and tables are pushed together. There seemed to be only one waitress when I was there, and she seemed a bit rushed---but managed to keep all the customers satisfied! There was a nice mix of local office workers, labourers and tourists, which I liked. At one point, what looked like a street person stopped by, and it seemed as if the owners and staff knew him. People were constantly coming to order takeway, and a couple of times queues formed at the door. Must be popular in the area!
Even though it's got the word ""Continental"" in its name, to me it seemed to be more British in its ambience and menu---which is eclectic (i.e., everything from Scotch eggs, to a Mexican tuna and a French brie sandwich!). If I wanted a ""continental"" cafe, I'll go to the Continent! Their canopy outside reads ""crazy salads,"" (?) ""pasta bar,"" and ""melt bar"" (what's that?---hot sandwiches?). The cafe doesn't have a website.",4
"Good grubFelt hungry so we called in, I had egg and chips , daughter had lasagne, both dishes were delish. Great place with a great range of reasonably priced dishes. Nice atmosphere with friendly staff.",4
"Looking for breakfastStumbled across Franx whilst looking for somewhere decent to eat breakfast as we were too early for the shops. We had a full English with extras and sausage and chips plus a couple of drinks and it came to less than £14! The food was Really good, quick friendly service and the place was constantly busy which goes to show how good it is.",4
"Just what you'd expectI have been working across the road and Franx is one of my preferred options to get food to take back to the office.

It has a good choice and they will make all sandwiches fresh if asked.

I liked their salads - the chicken kebab with mixed salad for £5.50 is a substantial box of fresh food for a reasonable price in Covent Garden.",4
"Great breakfastWe stopped here for breakfast this morning.. Great little cafe, the staff were very welcoming, the service was very good and quick. Very clean inside, it's obviously a popular cafe as it was always busy:) We had the English breakfast and a cheese and ham omelette,it was delicious ! Definitely recommend it, prices were good and a very varied menu.",4
Perfect!Great breakfast and good value for money. Also delicious pastries. The cherry bakewell was the best I’ve had. Would definitely return!!,5
"Great breakfast & great value.Great to know these types of traditional cafes are still around, offering a super breakfast for a great price. A very good selection of breakfast options are available, including good value set breakfasts, which include tea & toast. There’s a vegetarian breakfast option available too. All were well cooked and served quickly & efficiently. That said we didn’t feel rushed, despite Franx being understandably very busy!
Will definitely return next time we’re in the area.",5
Amazing Breakfast FabulousHad a late breakfast here yesterday and it was amazing. I had the full English with black pudding and my 2 friends had the vegetarian breakfast. The value for money is incredible and mine was cooked perfectly with very tasty crispy bacon. A must if you're in this area of London.,5
"Best English Breakfast, Excellent ServiceBest English Breakfast under £5, and I have tried a fair share of English breakfasts in London. Amazing staff-- always super friendly. Definitely recommend!",5
BreakfastVery good English breakfast. The toast was especially nice and buttery. Lovely rashers and perfect egg. Nice mug of tea and all for under£6. Highly recommended.,5
LovelyI came here yesterday with my Mum on a Theatre Trip and we saw this cafe and went in when we saw Jacket Potatoes. We wanted something simple. The guy who served was lovely. Very accommodating. The jackets were lovely. I enjoyed every bite. I tried to eat it all but it was very filling. The side salad was fresh too. We both thought the cafe was homey and cosy and we'd love to visit again if we are ever in that area on a day trip.,5
Great!What a gem. Great English breakfasts and a lot more good stuff on offer too all at very reasonable prices. The staff could not be more accommodating in varying the menu when asked. They also were happy about toasting some gluten free bread that we brought in 'just in case'.,5
"Great Breakfast!This is the second time that we have visited Franx for breakfast and once again the food was great. The menu is really varied. However, we opted for the Vegetarian Breakfast (Egg, mushrooms, hash browns, beans, tomato and toast) and a Full English. The lunch menu looked really good too! Would definitely recommend! Good for both eat in and takeaway too!",5
"100% recommendLooks can be deceiving, it small and rough around the edges but has the most fantastic, well priced local food!
100% recommend for everyone looking for a good english breakfast in a west-end cafe.
Only downside is because its small not many seats but you can sit outside.

Will defiantly return.",5
"Lovely to find a good old fashioned cafeGreat little place. Staff polite and helpful, food very tasty. I've had breakfast here a couple of times and pannini for lunch. Price is great and the coffee is good!",5

We've endured the loud mouth staff arguing outside..ok so it's hot. But most transparently..male staff member deliberately choose not to clear our table
despite the 3 visits we made to refill and purchase your beverages. The small petit guy who served was polite and a credit to.pret..see for youself",2
Less vegan more gluten free please!!!Too many vegan options and not enough gluten free options. Vegans choose to be vegan. I do not choose to be gluten free. A piece of meat won’t hurt a vegan. However gluten could really do some damage to people like me. I think you should be concentrating less on vegans and more upon actual food allergies and intolerances.,2
Over crowded.We stopped for a quick bite to eat. Very chaotic atmosphere. Very good staff at the til but the eating areas were crazy. So many people in there that were on thier lunch breaks from work bringing thier own lunches and drinks and just taking up all the seating. We had to wait a while to find a table. Huge queue for toilets also. Better facilities would increase customer satisfaction.,2
Quick in and out place but tasteless foodThis seems like a great place to get ready food but be warned that the sandwiches a really tasteless. They are safe and filling but at least the chicken ones are really bland. Go to m&s and have a chicken and avocado instead.,2
"OK until you need a customer toiletI went in here for a coffee and a snack accepting that it would cost rather more than the adjacent McDonald's. After our drink and snack with which all was fine I looked around for a sign to a customer toilet and failed to see one. I found a member of staff to ask - it was obvious that he was not a native English speaker. He gave me a garbled account and I asked him to repeat it. He said that their toilets had rubbish in front of them and so had to be locked. He then continued in very rapid English some thing which again I had to ask him to repeat. No doubt thinking himself very clever he spoke insultingly slowly "" Cross--the--road--and--use -- the-- toilets--at --McDonald's"". From an employee of an establishment that thinks it is so superior to McDonald's and charges so much more this is an incredible thing to tell a customer. If I'd wanted to use McDonald's (normally excellent) toilets I'd have given them my custom.",2
"Oldest Trick in the BookI have been using Pret for years but it is a shame some successful businesses appear to get arrogant or greedy at a certain point. Easiest way to make more money is to keep prices the same but reduce the content. The ever diminishing cadbury's cream example being an example. Now it has happened to Pret's baguettes. Not only are they smaller but they are inconsistent in their fillings which vary hugely in generosity. This isn't a reactionary review as I have been monitoring this for some time. Today's lunch was a chicken and bacon baguette, A dollop of chicken with a slither and a bit of bacon kind of stuck on the side almost looking like it is trying to hide the contents with at least an inch each end with no filling at all on one of those shrinking baguettes.

When I complained one time the manager agreed and made me one himself but I can't be doing that every time.

It's a shame I used to like Pret. Still tastes ok but consistency is lacking and doesn't feel like value for money anymore - off to subway.",2
"Hoped for something elseThere are various Pret-a- Mangers in London. So my curiosity pulled me towards it. But lo! What do I see... Nothing but variety of salads n fruits . Nothing great.
We were really hungry, but had to leave as we really didn't find anything that would have relieved our taste buds.",2
"Tried mango juice, and it was not mangoTried mango juice to beat the heat of London in Aug '18, the drink was not soo cold + the taste was not even close to mango. I ended up leaving the drink more than half as it was not tasty or even cold.",3
Smoked salmonSmoked salmon And veggie juice Was my snack meal for mid day Service good- self service Prices moderate,3
"Too busy!We came in for a quick bite at lunch time. The place was busy, very busy. The selection of food, as usual for this chain, was very good and service came with a smile. The main criticism was that there wasn't enough seating space and people had to stand and eat.",3
"Dependably ok.There everywhere in London ( & branches elsewhere ), I've been in many of & though their not mind blowing or selling anything that's wow, they are, like say Premier inn or McDonalds reassuring dependable. Food choice ( think wraps, sandwich's, salads ) & quality good, surrounding's ok & prices just this side of reasonable. One gripe, they do a nice line in breakfast brioche's, but from my experience, there never on sale when 1st open & it's always more 10 or 11 when available, why, it's a breakfast item ? Also & it's noticeable, staff in any branch never very personable - that though, a management issue & I'd have thought an easy, cost free fix.",3

"Like any fast food restaurantAfter all Pret A Manger is like any fast food restaurant chain. Organic food chain.
Coffee is good and the selection are broad.
The baguette, cookies and drink variety are good.
Feels like there is a Pret at any corner in London.
Staffs friedlyness differs from restaurant to restaurant.
Restaurant cleanness at the same level as at other fast food chains. There's a lot to improve.",3
"Stopped for LunchI grabbed a ham and cheese sandwich and they put so very much pepper on it. It was difficult to stomach. The croissants are very good, but if you do not like pepper I would not recommend the sandwiches.",3
Budget-Friendly Comfort FoodLove the soups and rice box. Very helpful when you need quick healthy bites. Lots of workers dine in for lunch. Service and price are also worth it.,3
Busy busythey can really manage the people through this site. I was about tenth in the queue and within a minute I was at the front My only critisim is that there is nothing ew as in inventive recipes. Same stuff everyday,3
Easy eatingYou find a Pret on almost every corner in London. They serve plenty of sandwiches in any variety. Good soups an fresh fruits. Uncomplicated dinning wherever you want for moderate prices.,4
Very good Food and serviceVery good Food and service Had my favorite Smoked Salmon With Green service very good prices moderate staff friendly nice location,4
"Good veg options at a budgetIf u are a vegetarian and looking for wholesome food on a budget in London .. head to one of the Prets spread all over the city .. the carrot and berry smoothie are highly recommended . The coffee also very good .. and the sandwiches like egg and mayo , Italian pesto very filling and good . It’s healthy wholesome food on a budget ... so highly recommended",4
"Busy but fresh, healthy foodI love this place, they serve pretty healthy fresh food with lots of options for vegetarians including sandwiches, salads and wraps. I also recommend the almond croissants (as long as you buy them in the morning by mid afternoon they are rather dry (unsurprisingly) since they have got aired all day..",4
"Tasty coffee, food, and good atmosphereI love Pret a Manger. This one is a particular favourite, it's right across of the Marble Arch at Hyde Park. There's a neat loft area you can go up and sit in. The vegetarian sandwiches are rather nice.",4
"Fresh, and good choicesExcellent choice for health conscious travelers. Pre-made salads and sandwich’s with several drink options...reasonably priced and located everywhere.",4
"Quick and easy food on the goEvery street has at least one Pret A Manger. Quite a wide selection of ready to eat sandwiches, wraps, hot soups and other cold sandwiches, drinks etc. There is also good selection for GF, Vegan etc. If you are in a rush and want to grab some good, fresh food, this is a great choice.",4
"A blessing for workers and tourists on the go.A local introduced me to the ""Pret"" near St. Paul's, and I have been carrying a list of Pret locations in London ever since. No need for an expensive, time-consuming sit-down lunch. Stop in for a hot or cold drink, prepackaged sandwich, a pastry. Sit at a table for a few minutes or take it to go. You might need a list of locations, too.",4
"Nice food, nice priceFreshly prepared on site, good quality and reasonable price. Good place to stop off when in and around central London...or indeed anywhere",4
Quick and HealthyQuick and healthy food on the go. Normally you have to wait in the line for order. But the available options are very good also for vegetarian and vegans,4
"Varied foodThey were all over London and you might think, gosh, it is like McD's, but the food was very good and consistent. The prices were good too!",5
Quick and Lots t choose from!This is a state for us each time we visit London. A great selection of quick bites and reasonably priced.,5
"best choicefor morning coffee or tea. some sandwiches, wraps, cereal or a juice. try the salads and the soups. there are more than 150 outlets in london. best value for money for some food on the go. our favourite was the outlet at tower hill.",5
"Healthy fast foodYou can’t beat pret for good quality, healthy food speedily! My family are devotees to the soup and have yet to try a flavour we don’t all love! Today’s vegetable ravine was no exception!",5
"Always TastyI wish we had this chain in Canada! The food is always fresh. From egg salad sandwich, to avocado salad, to hot chicken wrap; they never disappoint. And the prices are refreshingly affordable. Just be prepared for a crush of people in this take-away restaurant.",5
Really impressedWe don’t have this chain in Ireland but I wish we did. Really healthy options and mostly organic which is a big plus. Was in a lot of branches of this brand around London and it doesn’t disappoint whether it be for breakfast or lunch or a quick snack. I highly recommend it. Would love to see them expand to Ireland.,5
"Can you please open in Australia?I know for most UK people a Pret is a Dom a dozen but for me, a lowly Aussie traveller who was dying for some fresh veg and healthy meals after eating out for all meals everyday this establishment is a god send!!!!

I’ve tried both the hot and cold dishes and have nothing but positive things to say about them! The coffee leaves much to be desired but the drinks, salads and sandwiches are reasonably priced, fresh and convenient.

Please open in Brisbane!!! We need this in Aus! I’ll even start it for u!!!",5
"Delicious diet foodA diet food has never been delicious before. Daily prepared diferrent kinds of delicious soups, wraps and salads. Along my two weeks trip never gain weight and lost my appetite.",5
"Quick service & Quality fresh foodThis food chain is excellent value for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you are on the move. There is seating available too and adequate room for pram or wheelchair access. I would recommend finding one of these as you travel through the UK you will be rewarded with fresh ingredients and healthy alternatives. Adequate vegetarian and some vegan options available too.",5
"Love Love Love the salads!!We were in London for six days and I think we ate at the Pret A Manger around the corner from our rental flat at least once a day, either for a quick bite at breakfast or one of their outstanding salads at lunch. I'm still dreaming about the tomato, mozzarella and avocado salad, so fresh and loved the dressing. I wish we had chains like this in the US with healthy fresh foods! The chicken pesto salad was equally delicious!",5
"a simple -down to earth - and beyond placeWhen I saw that there was a hidden cafe I was thrilled- as the near by compettion is terrible. But then it was busy and a little confusing; queue or sit and wait? well the result was bit of both and food is clean and you keep thinking it's going to be 'alright'. So not a place for food but for a shelter, a place to meet, quieter, nicer than the mainstream, and it will all be fine :)",3
"Lovely little cafeHi Maria,

Thanks for your feedback. Hopefully we'll impress you a little more on your next visit and you find the food better.

Take care,

Mark :)",3
"Not treated well as a deaf personThe cafe itself was very nice inside, it was very busy however and was very limited in space. The food was nice but I felt there was still not much in the way of vegan food. I do love that they make it so easy to show which food has which allergens in them which a lot of places don't have.",3
"Weekly course in the friends centreHi Jessica,

Thanks for your feedback. I'm sorry we didn't have many vegan options available yesterday. We had just the soup, a few sandwiches and a cake, where we would usually have a vegan hot meal as well.

We were also especially busy over the past two days due to a very large conference that was occurring in our large auditorium 'The Light'. Lunchtimes are usually quite busy for us, but not quite as much!

We also have a restaurant in the basement level that serves at least one vegan main meal everyday and there is usually space on most days. I hope you will come and visit us again and have a better experience next time.

Mark :)",3
"DisappointingI normally love this place but today I was unaware that the place closed at 7pm and instead of being politely told when they were closing I was shouted at 20 seconds after all the lights went out. I am deaf and unless I'm looking at a person I'm unaware of auditory information, unless it's being shouted at me from the other side of a room! Apparently I was supposed to know what time they close and in the space between closing at 7pm on the dot and the 20 seconds it took me to pack my things I was ordered out in a rude manner. I explained to kasia who was working that I am deaf and at no point did she come and tell me, she responded that she doesn't have time to tell eve one individually - fair enough but there were three of us! She also tried to defend herself by saying I must understand her! A little bit of awareness of accessibility would go a long way for an organisation that markets itself as fairtrade. Selling over priced olive soap from Palestine means little to someone who is deaf and treated with rudeness. Shame as I love the place otherwise.",3
"Useful spot for quick coffeeHello Avihasan,

I am so sorry to read about your poor experience at our café. What you encountered was unacceptable, disappointing and far from the expectations we have of our staff. I will be discussing your review with the café staff today to ensure this experience is not repeated.

We strive to provide good friendly service and on this occasion we have fallen short. Please send me an email to markp@quaker.org.uk to see if I can make this up to you.

Kind regards,

Mark",3
"niceCafe also has an interesting book shop, Quaker books and all sorts of different religions plus mindfulness and personal growth. There is a quiet area for reading and enjoying a good fair trade cup of coffee or tea, plus scones and lite bakes.
Feels like a university book shop.",3
"Great for vegetariansI went here for lunch with a friend on a Satuday in September. We had really good salads with quiche. There were about 3 quiches available and all were vegetarian. I am a vegetarian and really appreciated this.

One thing upset my friend, they were throwing lots of food in the bin as it was closing for the weekend. We thought that this food could have been given to people especially homeless people.",4
"Service with a smileHello Jenfort,

Thanks for your feedback about our cafe's vegetarian lunchtime food, I'm glad you enjoyed your quiches.

We encourage my staff to discount food and give any food away that would otherwise be thrown out. I will re-iterate this point to our team today and thank you for bringing it to my attention.

See you in the café again soon.

Mark :)",4
Vegetarian/Vegan lunchtime cafeMy hubby and I popped in here for a coffee. It was clean with lots of seating and good service. A great place to meet up with friends or colleagues in the early morning. By lunch time the café was packed but there was still lots of food available. A nice little find.,4
"Great placeThank you Nina!

I'm pleased you enjoyed your first visit and you and your hubby were met with friendly service. See you again soon.

Mark",4
"Yummy food in a bright modern cafe - with books!A school friend of mine is a veggie, so we meet up here for lunch and a catch up. The food is quite outstanding and the portions are man size.

We normally have the soup and sandwich combo which at a just over a fiver is great value. No alcohol but plenty of coffe, tea and soft drink options. Queue up order and pay for the food and its delivered to your table ( best grab that first). Formica tables but the place is spotless and usually quite and peaceful.

Not open at night but does have a breakfast menu, but, not all day.

Never thought I would love a veggie place but I do love this one.",4
"Reliable friendly good causeHello John,

I'm really pleased that you enjoyed your vegetarian lunch and that the sizes were impressive. We have been working on our veggie meals to ensure the carnivorous amongst us go away happy as well!

Thanks for taking the time to review us and we'll surely see you again.

Take care,

Mark :)",4
"A small oasis at Euston (road) amongst traffic and mediocrityBrilliant spot to go and take five before your journey. Staff superb, place immaculate and reasonably priced too! What more can you ask for?",4
"Currently a building siteHello George! Thank you for you review. I hope you had a nice journey and make sure you come and visit us next time you are travelling through Euston. Take care, Mark",4
"The Only Way is EthicsI wasn't expecting this bright spacious cafe in this building (not sure why, but we all have our preconceptions).
The food looked inviting, with an array of fresh salads and quiches, alongside the hot dishes, paninis and cakes.
The seating area was adaptable and friendly, with upholstered benches or sofas actually in the book shop (kind of my dream - food and books....)
I had quiche and salad, my companion had a panini.
Getting served was a bit confusing at first - it wasn't clear if you had to queue up and ask for the quiches/salad and I ended up standing around in that peculiarly British way, hoping someone would notice me. Fortunately they did, and after that it was very efficient. (I think it was just because we were early for lunch and that bit wasn't quite ready).
Definitely recommended.",4
"Lovely food but too busyHello Fiona,

Thank you for your positive comments about our café and that you had a nice lunch with us. The layout can be a bit confusing for a first time visitor but our staff are always on hand to point our customers in the right direction.

I hope you come and visit us again soon.

Take care,

Mark",4
"Visit to Cafe with Friends and a DogWe were meeting at Euston Train Station for a coffee. In the middle of all the busy traffic of Euston Road this place is like a little haven with books and coffee, lovely sandwiches and cakes. Well worth a little walk.",5
"Peaceful and great valueThis simple cafe is like taking a break from the chaos of London. The sandwiches, cakes and drinks are unfussy but good quality and very fair prices. It's not rammed like everywhere else and there's a big terrace/garden where you can sit and get a bit of peace and fresh air while watching the masses rush by outside.",5

"2.5£ for a cheap mushroom topping...seriously?Nice place, friendly staff. The crêpe is just ok, but not more than that especially because it is a bit pricey 6,95 for a crêpe, my decision to give 1 point less is due to the price of the topping. How can you let pay 2.50£ for a bunch of cheap cup mushroom?!?! I think it is a robbery.",1
"Broken glass!Hello Frederico,

We feel really sorry the price of the mushrooms ruined your meal at MAMIE'S, and we really want you to understand how our prices work.
Firstly, concerning the crepes, our ingredients, are quality, fresh, and prepared with know-how.
We could buy canned ingredients/ mushrooms and propose you a cheaper price but that is not part of the values of MAMIE'S, and we describe ourselves as a Crêperie Fine, a real restaurant.
Also, we would like to know how did the price surprise you. Indeed, all the toppings have their price written just next to their heading on the tablets, in order to not let any place to surprise the customers. Do you think it is too small, or not at the right place? We really want this incident to not happen again.
Regards,",1
"FrustratedFood was OK but the glass of water I ordered was chipped at the tip which I didnt notice. As I drank I felt a piece of glass going through my throat which made me notice the chipped marks.
Anyhow called the waiter who gave me a casual C'est la vie (ahh well)! never again at this place!",1
"OK Food, Horrible place.A frustrating visit!! I read the reviews and thus pee booked a table. When we arrived on time we had to wait 10mins to be seated and then having ordered a few things via their electronic order system we had to wait a further 15mins to be told they didn’t have those items

It took 50mins to be served any food

So simply put! Rubbish service",1
"Presumptive, ignorant staff.The crêpes are actually quite good (can't say the same about the hummus entrée, which was ridiculously small and so overpriced).

However, the place has a terrible problem with the ventilation system. We had lunch upstairs and it couldn't be more smoky. We just wanted to get out of there quickly and when we did we smelled like smoke for the rest of the day. Completely unacceptable for the cute restaurant they pretend to be. Our eyes were itchy.

Also, they have this very modern system to orden through a tablet, but when you press the ""Call the Waiter"" button, they take ages to come. We had to come downstairs to look for them.",1
"Terrible service, mediocre foodI booked a table for two at this restaurant for 14:45 and I arrived on time, however my friend who is not local to the area was late. I sat down, had a glass of water and browsed the menu whilst waiting. Shortly after my friend called to say she was on her way but was lost as she didn't have any internet on her phone. I politely told the waiter that I was popping to Covent Garden underground station to get my friend and come back. However, on my way out of the store I overheard the waiter say to his colleague that I was a time-waster and that I was just after a free glass of water. Needless to say, my friend and I agreed it was best we didn't return.",1
"FOOD PAR EXCELLENCE, SERVICE ABYSMALHave eaten at this restaurant a few times now and it had become quite a favourite haunt of ours but yesterday's visit was a real disappointment. We ordered a combination of food and drink, including the set menu for two, and our main courses and drinks arrived within a reasonable time of placing our order. The food was, as always, excellent. Our drinks and main courses were served by two members of waiting staff and, on reflection, I think herein lies the problem. On completion of our main course, our plates were removed and the waitress relaid the table with cutlery but neither the waitress or waiter informed the chefs to prepare our desserts. In the meantime, we ordered another dessert and waited, and waited, and waited for at least 45 minutes!! I am sure that if I hadn't queried the delay we would still have been sat there when the curtain went up in the theatre! Instead of offering an apology the waiter attempted to argue against my complaint and defend the delay on a) his poor understanding of English b) other customers making them too busy (most of whom arrived after us!) and c) the Internet messing up the order. In my opinion he was very discourteous and to blame the Internet was ridiculous because the original desserts were ordered via a set menu at the same time as all our other food and drink. The way the complaint was handled was dreadful and the only concession was a grudgingly offered 15% reduction off of our bill but this was only disclosed when the bill was presented at our table. A restaurant of any repute would NEVER defend the indefensible but offer an immediate apology and bill reduction. This experience spoilt our entire evening and I doubt very much that we will use Mamie's again.",2
"""Vegan friendly"" ridiculousSharon,
Let me first apologize about the late answer, we try to particularly take care of negative testimonies.
I could never enough apologize for the bad experience you lived at the restaurant. We may have some internet problem sometimes, but it should never impact on the quality of your ordering, and about the staff's behaviour.
I feel truly sorry of your bad experience, even if as a loyal customer you know this is not the way it happens normally.
I really hope you’ll let us another chance to win back your heart.

Regards,",2
"Food average with shocking customer serviceThe staff are lovely and so kind- tried to be accommodating to our vegan lifestyle.

But the menu is terrible and not designed for vegans- !! On trying to pick a crepe and make it ""vegan"" we discovered the entire toppings or flavour of the crepe would be changed- so there were no vegan alternatives for cheese etc. It was suggested we may as well use a plain crepe and choose our veg toppings individually.

There was a short wait and when the food was brought out. I would say it was distinctly average. For two pounds per vegetable topping you would get a few lettuce leaves or maybe a few mushrooms and a quarter of a potato perhaps. Not worth the money. Do not waste your money!

So for a few cheap vegetable toppings we designed a crepe that wind up costing 13 quid each (more expensive than anything else on the menu with meat and vegetables) and it was not filling at all.

In terms of dessert crepes - again no vegan ice cream or milk alternatives. So you could have a crepe with jam and fruit.

Lovely restaurant and staff are very accommodating but it is not 'vegan friendly' or moderately priced for what you get; this in my opinion is ridiculous and don't waste your time as a vegan coming to this restaurant .",2
"Make the calculation straightLovely ambience, food was ok, flavours were good - I had the 4 cheese and my friends had the complete and forest crepes. However, they were slightly too burnt and crispy - not as soft and fluffy as we have had them as other creperies. Service was terrible. All seemed fine at first, although when we politely asked the waitress to kindly take a photo of us (I was taking my friend who had newly arrived to London), she said she was too busy working as she was the only one serving 3 three floors and briskly walked off (even though we saw another waitress also serving tables). We found this to be very rude and unfriendly. Appreciate you're busy but at least offer to take our pic at a later time? Maybe customer service in London is different than in Sydney? Then when we asked for the bill, she came over with the eftpos machine and said ""oh I have to do something else"" and walked away to do who knows what and came back with no apology. We didn't pay the service charge which is a first for me. Will not be going back there or recommending this place to anyone else. Can get better crepes elsewhere I'm sure! A very unwelcoming place!",2
"Once very good, once very bad...생각보다 그렇게 맛있는 음식아니다 흔히 어디서나 맛본 음식이다. 그리고 계산할때 가격 꼼꼼히 보라 직원이 엉뚱하게 계산하다.

It is not such a delicious food than I thought. And look at the price when you calculate the staff wrong calculation",2
"Very expensiveHi Yang Jin,
Thank you for your feedback, we are always doing our best to try and improve so we’re grateful for your review. We are very sorry that you found our food to be disappointing, was there anything in particular that was not to your liking?
Concerning the problem that you seemed to experience with regards to a calculation error, we have seen that you mentioned this issue on a few of our platforms indeed. Unfortunately, we couldn’t understand exactly what appeared to be the matter and thus have tried to contact you through Instagram yesterday (following your first comment). You might not have had time to send us an answer, but please do. In order to understand with you what went wrong, we need to get in touch with you… We’re very keen on correcting any mistakes.
Once again we really apologise about this issue.
We’re waiting on an answer from you, and in the meantime, wish you a very lovely day!",2
"Cosy little place for a snack - not a mealThis is a very cosy place in a chic street near Covent Garden and the Royal Opera. The seats are comfortable and the decor is homely and traditional British. The food is very attractively presented but not very substantial. The pancakes are paper-thin and the filling of the one I had (smoked salmon and cream cheese) was meagre. Even with a side salad, I didn't really feel I'd had a meal. The drinks list seems to be mainly cider. The Armorique cider I had was very nice but it would be pleasant to have a choice of wines too.
Verdict: if you're hungry, go elsewhere.
The downstairs is probably wheelchair accessible. The upstairs is not.",3
"Better Book a table in advanceHi there,
First, we would like to thank you for taking your time to write us your detailed feedback. We are also glad you enjoyed the place.
It's normal that you found our galettes thinner than a pancake; indeed it is the traditional way to do it in Britanny. We feel sorry you didn't felt replete after your meal. Generally, it is advised to eat a galette as main and a sweet crepe as dessert if you are hungry.
Concerning the wines, we actually have a choice of 9 wines, in addition to our 19 different ciders. If you ever want to have another try at MAMIE'S, we would love you to taste some of them. Have a nice day!",3
"Delicious crepes but marred by very expensive ciderVisited twice as a couple.
First we booked a table in advance for brunch and we were both happy with the food and service. Second time we tried to have breakfast without any booking on a weekend and it was full so we were seated by the window. Great food and service but the down side was the front door making a loud noise everytime it closes. Its so loud and our table actually shakes. Will still come back but I'd make sure I get a table first.",3
"Nice serviceWe enjoyed sharing 3 crepes - they are tasty with the option of including additional toppings. The downside is that the choice of French cider to accompany the French crepes is very expensive. The menu is misleading in listing only one price for the cider (when in fact there is more than one price). The waiter, despite the “French friendliness”, should have at least explained when we ordered the cider. The bill was very high as a consequence, leaving a very unsavoury taste to the meal - of being duped.",3
"Quaint placeHi,
First, we would like to thank you for your feedback. It is really important for us to have your point of view to enhance our service day after day. We are sorry you felt duped by our pricing system, but actually, all prices can be seen at the moment you choose your cider bottle size. We will try to think about a solution to make it even clearer for our customers.
We hope this mixed feeling won't prevent you to give us another try.
Have a lovely day!",3
"Not greatI pre-booked a table for 5 people. Ended up in the lower section. Very tight and a bit noisy. Good food , a bit complicated ordering system through an Ipad. I guess not complicated for average people..... Very nice and friendly staff. Busy and tight place.",3
"Great pancakes pity about the restaurantWe visited here recently for sweet crepes.
It’s a lovely little restaurant with nice staff.
I wasn’t as taken with it as everyone else has been.
I thought our crepe was a bit lacking in the fruit although it was
equal to the diagram on the menu. The fruit was also cold on the hot crepe. It could have been heated up I thought (?)
The coffee was only average.",3
"Not as good as the reviews unfortunatelyHi Alison,
Thank you for giving us your feedback about your MAMIE'S experience.
If you feel you don't have enough fruits, don't hesitate to call a waiter, who'll talk to the Chef.
Some fruits are presented chilled and not warm (as pears for example) because our will is to present the pear chilled to preserve its savour and freshness. If you ever come back, and if you prefer your fruits warm, just submit your request to the Chef via the tablet.It will be our pleasure to serve it this way for you.
Concerning our coffee, we import a quality one and mould it at the minute. We understand our waiters might not be baristas, but never hesitate to let us know if you like your coffee a certain way. Once again, thanks for your very useful feedback.
Have a lovely day!",3
"?Value for money?Pros: Great location, tasty fois gras mini pancakes.
Con: the whole place stinks of damp and sewage. Waiters are gorgeous, but totally useless - I was told my friend was waiting upstairs when, in fact, he was in the basement - no one bothered to escort me to the table. Had to ask multiple times for tap water. Cocktails, ice cream and galettes were noting spacial.
If you want amazing galettes then check out L'Ami Malo in the city.",3
"Three and a half - nice enough!I’ve been to Mamies twice.
Both times the food was great.
But a restaurant is not just about the food.
The first time, I was seated at a communal table by the front door.
The catch didn’t work, so every time somebody used the door (constantly), I got an icy blast.
The second time, we were seated upstairs.
They have a nifty tablet-based ordering system.
But the service was very slow (despite it being 6pm) and much worse, two of the waiters spent about 15 minutes rearranging the tables and chairs noisily, speaking exremely loudly in French, as if we weren't there.
Try enjoying a meal in that way...
We were also seated by two lavatory doors and every time anybody used the lavatory, we got another icy blast.
Great, authentic Breton pancakes both sweet and savoury, lovely drinks too.
But the ‘don’t care’ attitude of the staff spoiled our evening.",3
"After The TheatreWe had just enjoyed 42nd Street at the Royal Drury Theatre and were looking for dinner and happened on this delightful place across the street. Fabulously friendly wait staff, crepes and cider. It was late and near closing but they were indulgent and kind.",4
"GoodUnique cocktails, really delicious. Nice staff, but they didn’t introduce themselves which was annoying because I like to know who’s serving me",4
"Had some problems but the owner sorted it outI'm in two minds about my experience here, on the one hand we had a few issues with food, forgetting extras we ordered, waitress disappearing to chat with friends and worse issues still but on the other hand, when I contacted the owner about them directly, he was very sincere in his reply and left me believing that indeed he would deal with them so surely this business must be rewarded for that. This is the reason I've gone with 4 stars instead of 2 or 3.

To briefly outline some of the problems, it was a Sunday and no actual management present, therefore the staff took advantage and it showed from the slack waitress service and bad attitude about it, to missing items on our dishes that by the time the extras arrived on a separate plate because they were forgotten, it was way too long a wait and the meal had to be finished or else it would have gone cold. Our galettes were cooked way too long to the point they were crispy all the way through with large burnt areas. There were even worse issues but I have raised these very serious concerns with the owner already and strongly believe future customers will not experience these problems.

Apart from this, there were positives. The fillings of each galette and dessert crepe were fantastic and definitely of higher quality. The menu is wonderful, really inventive fillings and dessert mixes with the option to customise with adding or subtracting items. The idea of utilising a tablet (see pic) to get the attention of a server when needed or to order further items is brilliant - when the servers are on point, it works very efficiently.

Did you know they do a range of speciality beers and ciders to pair with their food? I was impressed with the range, the knowledge the waiting staff had of each item and my cider choice (see pic) went perfectly with my food.

We ate Goat's Cheese with Chicken Galette and Smoked Salmon Galette (see pic) which was presented beautifully. The apple & elderflower mocktail cites rosemary as an ingredient but it's actually just a garnish and too large for the small martini glass, so that it tends to fall out everytime you pick up the glass (see pic). It's a very expensive mocktail for the small glass it's served in, considering there is zero alcohol in it - perhaps the execution is the problem.

Dessert was Crepe with lemon curd, strawberry ice cream & raspberry coulis & added grilled banana (see pic), but as mentioned earlier the banana was missing and it was a very long wait before it turned up, but covered in deep fried onion and garlic pieces. The kitchen staff had not cleared the frypan of previous savoury food they had cooked when they did my banana. In any event the crepe was divine, I highly recommend it (minus the banana). I also highly recommend the Hot Caramel (see pic) which was so delicious that if you wanted something sweet but not a crepe, you could enjoy this as a kind of lighter dessert. It was awesome.

Lastly the Chocolate Shake (see pics) - what a disappointment. The tablet picture shows a lavish shake dripping with topping, what you actually get though is something that has no resemblance to the picture whatsoever! Again, execution problems I think. It was not enjoyable or sweet. I did really like the communal table downstairs (see pic) and the outdoor seating (see pic) which is perfect in the summer.",4
"Good food; irritable serverMy husband and I, our daughter, and her friend ate lunch upstairs here on June 23. The galettes were delicious. Two different women served the upstairs tables. The French server was charming, but we had an odd exchange with the other server. My daughter ordered a milkshake and decided to share it with her friend. When the shake arrived, we asked for a second spoon. The server said, ""Next time, tell me you are sharing so I don't have to come up the stairs twice."" We were polite, quiet, and low-maintenance (other than the spoon request), and she had to come upstairs again several more times for other tables, so her irritation, and the fact she expressed it, was an unpleasant surprise.",4
"Unusual ordering, but lovely food and helpful serviceWe had a pre theatre lunch in this French galette restaurant .
You order via a small computer device, seems unusual and a bit off putting at first , but the staff were very helpful. After first try it was easy. The galettes ( type of pancake with fillings) were delicious. We then had a dessert too, again very nice. It could have been a cheap meal ,but it ended up quite expensive. Yet we will go again. They Are providing a different type of lunch in amongst all the other, mainly English and Italian restaurants",4
"Good food - expensive drinksHi Frederika,

Thank you for this lovely feedback. We are glad you appreciated the experience. We would be happy to know what we could do to get your five points. We hope to see you very soon to taste some new galettes.
Have a lovely day!",4
"Relaxed food with a differenceThis certainly a genuine French restaurant with French speaking staff who are very friendly. There is a great selection of ciders, some at high prices, and a more moderate range of beers and wines. Also an unusual and gimmicky ordering system on a iPad like device delivered to your table. Inevitably this means that the personal touch is diminished. Blinis Foie Gras were delicious as a starter but only 5 mouthfuls for almost £9 represent a high price. La Bonaparte Galette with cheese, potato and ham tasted good although by itself is unlikely to fulfil your appetite. Dessert of La Jacques Cartier (pecan and ice-cream pancake) is to be recommended and rather unusual. However £7.25 for 174ml of red wine is over priced. I enjoyed the experience but the food, although very good, does not match up to the best similar restaurants in France. Price for a pre-theatre meal for 2 was £60 including service.",4
"Super cool & tastyHi there,
Thank you very much for your feedback. We are glad you enjoyed your meal. We feel sorry you found the foie gras a bit expensive. Indeed, the foie gras is a luxury product. Concerning the wine, we try to provide a good quality of wine, from France.
However, we hope you'll come back very soon!",4
"A little bit differentFor something different than the usual sandwiches or salad, this was an excellent choice. Crepes cooked to a lovely crisp finish and wide choice of fillings to suit most, there will be something to keep everyone happy. Then add the desert choices and it gets even better.

We enjoyed our lunchtime experience at Maime’s and look forward to another opportunity to visit when back in London.",4
"Fun food, fantastic ciderHi Gihan,

Thank you for this lovely feedback, we are glad that you enjoyed your whole experience at MAMIE'S. Don't hesitate to let us know how could we get your 5 points, we would be interested to know some more about it!
We wish you an excellent day!",4
"Lovely brunchWe enjoyed a hot chocolate, one savory crepe, and one sweet crepe.

The savory crepe was deliciously flavorful and a bit crunchy, we really enjoyed it.

For sweet we ordered the apple crepe and it was delicious!

We were a little disappointed at the crepe-to-filling ratio. Most places we have visited in the past are probable less authentic and tend to serve crepes stuffed with fruit and Nutella. So if you’re expecting that sort of thing you may be disappointed.

Go in with expectations for an authentic French crepe and you will love it!",5
Tasty and well pricedWhilst we were going about covent garden we looked for somewhere to grab some lunch and this place came up. What a find! You order via an ipad at your table. The waiting staff were super friendly and helpful and the food was amazing. Great tasting and the individual ingredients were quality and really generous portions on top of that. Thank you for a great experience :),5
"A Great Find. Delicious and Sensibly Priced!Hello Aleks,
We’re blessed you enjoyed our galettes and the toppings, and we’ll forward your nice feedback to the staff. We hope to see you soon to taste other recipes!
Have a good day!",5
"So goodWe found this place on the internet when looking to book a pre-theatre lunch. The reviews were good so we went with it and were not disappointed!

It is a wonderful little restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere and friendly helpful staff. You order your food on a tablet and it’s brought to you, really quick and simple!

The galettes and crepes were delicious and authentic, exactly as we have had in France. Do not miss this place, it’s a hidden gem!",5
"AmazingWe went there yesterday, we had the blinis smoked salmon and cream cheese crêpe and a true of desserts with tea.. everything was perfectly presented and very good, fast and perfect service, we will come back , thanks guys.",5
Amazing French momentAmazing authentic French crepes and galettes. Including French drinks (soda's aswell) generally really good food!,5
"Cutest Crepe EverWe came in at evening, and we were very surprised of the high quality service and food ! Very good French cuisine with charming French people. A very good moment. I recommend this restaurant with no hesitation. The crepes were excellent !
The French brother and sister",5
"Excellent, again!Lovely little cafe with great choice of crepe and drinks. Relaxed theme and digital ordering was fun. Vegetarian freindly.",5
"Perfect.Having visited earlier in the year, we returned to MAMIE'S with friends and we were not disappointed! Delicious food, excellent service, well worth the visit. We will be back again and again and again! Our thanks to the chef and wonderful staff.",5
"Delicious. Fantastic valueGreat food. Well priced. Big portions. Great staff. Quick and efficient ordering system (via Ipad). We were visitors to London, but recommend this place to all locals and fellow travellers visit! Salut!",5
"PoorStaff were great. That’s where it ends. My food was poor, sent back and the same plate returned. Yuck. They removed the immediate problem item from the bull and although thankful, there were additional parts and it want considered. Never would I return, sorry, wasted Saturday evening.",2
"Shame about the lack of hell.We were only room only in our hotel so ate out for breakfast and wished we'd had dined in. The waitress was pleasent enough but the food fell quite short of what I'd have expected for a trendy looking society eatery.
My wife had the bacon & pancakes which were ok but my eggs hell should have been re-named 'eggs sunny afternoon meadow in heaven' I expected my ears to be blowing steam from the chilli and spices but it was in fact pretty tasteless.
We also ordered a 2nd latte as the breakfasts arrived, we'd both finished eating and the waitress brought the 2nd coffee, i think we'd been forgotten as the barista was hardly run off her feet behind the bar.",2
"Emperor's new/old clothersHad lunch here yesterday with family before going to the Cambridge Theatre afternoon matinee, which is opposite.

To be honest this place struck me as a bit of a tourist trap restaurant that’s had an attempted ‘hipster’ makeover (like the name for a start and having various utensils and condiments in slightly quirky presentation) to make it more trendy & appealing.

But under the thin layer of Artisan pretence it had the usual tourist trap attributes such as trying to up-sell absolutely everything.

“Couple of wafer thin slices of cheese on your club sandwich sir?”. That will see £2 on your bill.

“An egg with your burger?”.

“Extra sausage?”

The list goes on.

They will put some olives down which you never asked for. Another £3.50 on the bill.

Of course they will offer bread which comes as stale, sorry I mean sourdough and another few quid on the bill.

12.5% optional service added at the end - they know most people will feel awkward about asking for the ‘optional’ service to be removed which is why they do it. Let’s be honest, it’s a dirty trick.

That all leaves a bad taste to be honest, trying to sting you for a few quid at every opportunity.

So as I said - a bit of fraud really trying to represent themselves as some gastro Artisan eatery when in fact it’s another West End tourist restaurant. They even have Fish & Chips (nothing wrong with that, I like Fish & Chips, just pointing out it’s not an innovative dining experience the name would suggest!)

The food itself? It wasn’t too bad to be fair, it’s just the other stuff made me think I haven’t been in a restaurant like that for many years - normally when I’m the tourist (which I’m not in London) - and don’t intend to be again anytime soon.

The tables are too small as well and there’s no children’s menu.",2
"Good food, pretty poor serviceWifi did not work.
Service very unattentive.
Waitress piped up when we went to smoke together asking us if we wanted the bill (obviously thought we were leaving without paying) other than that we had to ask for everything we had.
Me and my party were also bumped into on 3 different occasions by waiting staff not looking where they were going. Altogether pretty amateur on the FOH side. Not much care had gone into the service delivered.",2
"DISAPPOINTING SERVICEWe have just eaten here on a Saturday afternoon. Everything started off really well, good service and excellent food. We were asked if we wanted cake and that we could choose from a selection. The waiter Thiago then seemed not to bother after that, preferring to chat with a guy at the bar and using his mobile phone. He never bothered to come back and after 20 minutes we managed to extract a bill, no thank you or explanation as to why he didn't take any further orders from us. Very odd behaviour and spoilt an otherwise excellent meal.",2
"DisappointedSeared scallops were great to begin with and service was excellent however our mains; were the epitome of our disappointment. Ordered the crab linguine and expected it to be slightly on par with the price but turned out to be very low in quality. First experience here. Don't think I'll be going back, not in the near future at least.",2
"Good breakfast, Slow serviceWe were walking from our hotel up through Seven Dials towards the British Museum when we came on this little cafe looking for breakfast. The cafe is also open for lunch and dinner and has a bar, so it is not just set up for breakfast. Our table was very small and we move the condiment rack to another table just to make enough room for our plates. Took awhile to get coffee and tea and over a half hour to get orders of french toast and pancakes, even though it was not crowded.

But breakfast was very good. No one asked to refill my coffee which was gone by the time food arrived.

Total tab was $34. By comparison, our hotel hot and cold buffet was about $32. So this represents only an average value.",3
"Pleasant service, poor foodHad dinner here - one main, 2 small plates and chips. Everything was poorly cooked and flavourless; scallops overdone with horrible chewy bacon; lamb chops flabby and unappealing, with astonishingly bland anchovy butter. We sent the bread back because it was stale and dry, alongside some really horrible balsamic vinegar. Staff were very pleasant, and I enjoyed the Spanish cider very much. The best thing on the table was the Tiptree ketchup. But won't be going back.",3
"Great drinks and snack, dinners hit or missWe stopped here for a snack on our arrival day in London as it was close to our apartment and a table opened up on the sidewalk just when we were looking for a bit and place to rest our feet. The service was super friendly and our snack of scrabled eggs with smoked salmon and avocado toast and an order of twice dipped chips was delicious and hit the spot so we decided to return for a pre-theater dinner a few nights later with another couple. The dinner wasn't quite as successful.

The pre-dinner drinks were lovely with creative cocktails and very nice wine by the glass options. Fish and chips were a big success (although we didn't love the mushy peas) but a Cobb Salad special was a huge disappointment with no hard cooked egg, or tomatoes. It was basically a small salad with a bit of chicken and bacon thrown in and way over-priced for what it was. A pasta dish was pretty blah but there was a generous basket of good bread.

I'd recommend it for drinks and snacks and for a nice fish and chips and/or breakfast but I'd skip it for dinner.",3
To try againUnfortunately I have not tried the burger so I will give another try to have an overall opinion. ..In the meantime I have tried English breakfast and it was good but not over rated..the bacon was little bit cold and not so crunchy ...aside potatoes were very good...peraphs I had high expectations on the dish...The staff is very kind and customer oriented and they made us feel very good.,3
"Ok, but a little disappointingGreat start with friendly staff and since bread and oil/vinegar brought straight after we sat down. We then ordered and had to wait an unexpectedly long amount of time for our food to arrive.

When it did arrive, two steaks, they were on the rare side of medium and also pretty cold, as if they'd been sitting for a while waiting for something else to be cooked.

They did take them back and heat them up, and the new potatoes were very nice.

I'm not sure I'll go running back, maybe I just caught them on a very busy evening.",3
"Cafe vibe, not much elseThe team are nice, but the service was slow, and drawn out. Nothing appeared to be urgent, and some dishes were brought out well after everyone else's.

It's a nice place, although not hugely comfortable, tables are very close together, so you are bumped into when people move or sit down.

Food was good, and generous in size, although the chips were slightly undercooked in my opinion, the burger was very good though and huge! The meat was really big, so a really generous size burger.

Not too bad price wise, standard for London.",3
"Nice but didn't feel special enough for the price.Had Eggs Benedict breakfast which was nice but I didn't think it was anything special. Absolutely nothing like the picture's I've seen but maybe that was a different Eggs Benedict selection on the menu than the one I ordered. The part I didn't like most was the 12.5% service charge added onto the bill. If it was on the menu, then I didn't see it so please beware of it. It also doesn't mention this gratuity on the card payment machine either. The service wasn't anything over an above what an establishment should be doing as the norm for the prices they charge so just begrudge paying the 12.5% without realising. I will definitely will remember next time (if there is a next time).",3
RefreshingI had one of the cocktails and was very refreshing. I would without a doubt come here again. It is so good and the staff are great.,4
"FRIENDLY RESTAURANT WITH A NICE VIBEPerfectly situated within reach of Soho but not in it, this restaurant/bar is a great place to eat at virtually any time of day. On this occasion we had just been a matinee performance at a nearby theatre. My companions and I have eaten here before and have always been looked after superbly by Shukri.
We started off with cocktails and followed them with a couple of startersL chickpeas and tacos, which we shared. We then tucked into our main courses, which comprised burgers, steaks and a vegetarian dish. We washed all of this down with two bottles of Suavignon Blanc. The bill came to £154, incl service.",4
"Expect a nice fun evening.We went for the 50% off food offer, which was off everything. Selection was good, not too much but enough variety. The stuff were so friendly. Even though it was a bot empty there was a nice atmosphere. Still ended up quite expensive but we did have a drink so I suppose fair enough.",4
"Meet with friendsPerfect for a catch-up with friends. It is quiet in the morning a gets a bit noisier as the day goes on. Easy to meet, eat and chat.",4
"Good food and good serviceVisited with friends and family , waited for over half hour on other friends and the staff were lovely, they did not try to rush us. We sat with drinks and just waited till they came and staff did not hassle us at all.
We all had something different and all enjoyed the meals.
Very cool laid back atmosphere and we will def return soon.",4
"Perfect late dinnerLovely location, few meters away from Seven Dials. Nice staff, that welcomes you with a smile and a joke even on a busy Saturday night when you ask for a late dinner.
The choice of food is broad and varied. I got the club sandwich and it was wonderful and super tasty, with sourdough bread and a sliced avocado inside that personalized a classic recipe. Even if service was on top, the price was reasonable.",4
"Nice breakfast but nothing specialWe were staying in a West End hotel and went out looking for breakfast, ambling through side streets towards Seven Dials. It was a case of “looks OK, clean, not too busy, not too empty” sort of decision to go in.

Nice meet and greet, and then onto tea/coffee and chilled water (which never ran dry). S had the full English and I had the kedgeree. Both were fresh and tasty but there was no curry flavour to the kedgeree (which is something I really look forward to).

Overall, yes, a nice breakfast and a reasonable price for the area. I doubt I’d go back but only because there’s no much to choose from around there.",4
"Enjoyable meal and good valueWith a hour or so to spare before the local theatre performance began we looked for a small eatery and found the BSS. Staff were welcoming and we were soon seated with menus. May seem at first to be a limited menu but depth in appeal is evident once you read beyond the titles. 2 Classic Clubs were chosen and a sharing dessert of donuts followed, neither of which disappointed. Service was good with a nice ambient atmosphere helped break the ice with the next table diners who themselves were on a short break. Would seek out this place if in the area again. Price was reasonable.",4
"Good place for informal lunchI have been several times with friends, and never disappointed. Food is quite good and you can have a good Sunday brunch. Not exceptional, but I would indeed recommend this place",4
"Really niceWe popped in here for a relaxed pavement lunch and a little people watching earlier today. Very tasty food, charming service. What's not to like? Well worth a visit.",4
A little JewelWhat a surprise.. fresh delicious food. I’m not a vegetarian but these dishes were tempting and proved to be extremely good. My companions had other food all good and served well bt friendly staff. Excellent there should have been queues here not outside Jamie Oliver’s which couldn’t match it.,5
"Love this placeWe have been here twice now, both times for breakfast/brunch and both times we have loved it. Great menu, lovely surroundings, delicious food and very nice, attentive staff....what more could you ask for",5
"Great prices, fantastic food & fab cocktailsWe visited for an evening meal, fantastic customer service and great vibe throughout restraunt. Fantastic options on the menu great portion sizes. Very reasonably priced. We would definitely visit again.",5
"2 4 1 happy hourCame here with a friend for cocktails and catch up. It was 2 for 1 from 4pm-6pm. Nice ambience, friendly staff and not too busy.",5
Great for a pre-theatre meal close to DonmarWelcoming atmosphere. Friendly and efficient waiter. Tasty food with an imaginitive flair. Prompt service - very welcome as we had tickets for the nearby Donmar Warehouse theatre. Impressive candles on the bar!,5
"Delicious and great serviceBeautiful cocktails , fab food in generous portions. Service speedy and friendly. Quirky table condiments! Lovely atmosphere and perfect location - what’s not to like!",5
"Excellent drinks, staff, service! Bypass the big chains and go here!Visited for drinks one evening, stumbled across this place last time we were in London and had an awesome time. Staff great, great drinks!",5
"Good coffee and breakfastAfter poking our noses into several cafes for breakfast around the 7 dials area, this was perfect for our needs. Coffees were excellent, good mix of breakfasts on offer for a family. Full english, eggs and bacon and eggs Benedict were sampled - all good. Tempted by the pancakes. Decent size restaurant, reasonable price and good selection. The other cafes were rejected for failing on one of these.",5
"WelcomingWe were staying in the Seven Dials area and after a few hours mooching we came across this cafe and decided to call in for a coffee. So glad we did. The latte was gorgeous and while we were there I spotted that they did warm doughnuts so it was a case of having to try them. When they arrived there were five round golf ball sized doughnuts with cream and chocolate sauce. Absolutely Devine. The Staff were so friendly and welcoming. The service was quick and we never felt rushed. Their philosophy is too much of a good thing is a good thing and they didn’t disappoint. We were at the theatre the following two nights and decided to have a pre theatre meal here. The first night I had the chicken club sandwich which was really nice. Loads of salad and mayo and a good chunk of chicken. Had to eat it with a knife and fork as there was no way you could get it in your mouth. My husband had salted beef sandwich which he enjoyed so much he had it two days running. The second night I had fish and chips...or should I say whale and chips. The fish was cooked to perfection, wonderful batter and scummy double dipped chips. The meals were great value for money. Around the £10 mark. Every time we went we were made to feel like it was our local and we were meeting old friends. I felt really comfortable in there. It was a great place to have a cuppa, meet friends, have a beer or grab a meal. First class service and I wouldn’t hesitate to visit again.",5
"One of my favourite places to escape for a coffee and snackI've been visiting the Balans chain restaurants for years, and never had a bad meal yet. The Seven Dials one is my favourite, as it is less well known and so less busy at peak times. The staff are always extremely friendly. Coffees and sweet potato fries are particulary good. I tried the apple crumble recently, which is hands down the best I've ever had.",5
"Really disappointedI remembered it was much better, but I’ve been quite disappointed considering the mains were cold (the meat) or invisible and over cooked (the plaice). Each costs 18£.
Really disappointed.
I can’t actually understand the good reviews.
I wouldn’t recommend this place at all.",1
"Can't get any serviceHi Fiamma33
So sorry to read your negative review but thank you for bringing these matters to our attention.
It is so disappointing to read that your food did not meet your expectations and would hope that if you let one of our team know of your issues they could have replaced the meal for you. Your comments are taken very seriously and will be discussed with our team.
We never like to learn a guest has left unhappy, customer satisfaction is our top priority. If you are in the area again we would very much like you to return to The Wilmington and let us give you the exceptional experience you should have received on this last visit.

kind regards
Amelia",1
"Just a bad exoerience!Despite the reviews, I have now left this place twice because no one will serve me. I'm reminded of the Yogi Berra phrase "" nobody goes there anymore... It's too crowded."" Food and brew was great the one time I was served, but after two failed attempts in six months waiting 20 minutes for someone to serve me, I'll turn to one of the other 10,000 pubs in London.",1
"Lovely evening ruined by the bar staffMy husband and I were looking forward to having brunch at this place which looked like a nice pub advertising great ""Bloody Marys"" and we wanted eggs Benedict as well. It was 10:10 A.M and the place had just opened. Two ladies at the bar and a man cleaning up the window panes. It was still empty except for another person who had arrived a few minutes before. We sat and started looking at the brunch menu. I ordered a Bloody Mary to come with my eggs Benedict. The server told me that it'll take 15 minutes or so to prepare it...a few minutes later she came back and said it'll take at least an HOUR because they did not have anything to make it and they had to go and buy the ingredients!!!! I couldn't believe my ears and said why then can you advertise on the menu as well as write on the board about your famous Bloody Marys? The French manager is obviously a disorganized person, and unable to tackle the situation. We left upset, he was on his high horse and said I was a ""racist"" because I claimed he was ""disorganized"", how can I be a racist for I am myself French!!!! When my husband wanted to pay for the cappuccino he had ordered and not drink, that man kept on saying :""No no we don't want your money!"" and for sure, we don't EVER want to return to your place! The food may be delicious as well as the Bloody Marys but this kind of attitude is pathetic!",1
"Lovely food and staff BUT....It is commonly thought that to get a 5 star rating, you need a member of staff to go the extra mile and add a human touch. This also works the other way; a lovely meal with friends was turned into a bad night by a barman that thought he would have some ""banter"". Completely unnecessary, you would have thought that people skills and social awareness are a pre-requisite in this industry.",1
"Irrational security staffA Saturday night and the food was excellent, the staff great but the noise made it impossible to hold any sort of a conversation. The music in the bar area was so loud people had to shout at the top of their voices to be heard and while it was a bit quieter in the restaurant, particularly after the waitress had turned the speaker down, it was still far too loud for comfort. It was a pity since the food and everything else was fine. I can't recommend it and I certainly won't be going back",1
"Rude StaffWent for a long dinner for a friend's birthday, stayed for quite a while. Food is tasty and atmosphere good. We left at midnight and I realised I needed the bathroom as soon as I stepped out of the door, but the bouncer wouldn't let me go back in as it was almost closing out time. Seemed really irrational given he clearly saw we had finished dinner and were leaving as all my friends were already outside. Not really the treatment I expect after dropping over £500 on dinner.",1
"Mr austinVisited here twice on the same day. Firstly around 2pm and the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy. Took the staff around ten minutes to tell us no table available which was fine so we left. Went back again around 5.30pm for drinks and I sat at a table which was empty in the bar area while my husband went to the bar for drinks. I'd sat there amongst other couples who were non-diners for around five minutes when the employee who had told us there was no table available earlier came bustling over. He said he had reserved the table I was sitting at for another couple who wanted to dine there. When I pointed out that there was no reserved sign on the table he lifted up the glass candle holder that was sitting on a white plate which had 'reserved' written on said plate. It was almost comical.When I pointed out that the candle was on top of the reserved sign and was in no way visible so I didn't see why we should move he got particularly agitated and was very unprofessional. He clearly wanted the table for the couple who would be spending more.
No apologies were made to us. We left and took our money elsewhere.
I've called The Wilmington this morning to try and talk to a manager but still no one has come back to me.
Very disappointed. Will not be tempted to make it third time lucky.",1
Kitchen closed at reservation time!!Been to this restaurant numerous times and highly recommended it to friends and was due to book a work dinner but after last night I will not be returning. Not sure if new chefs or owners but the steak and chips which is my usual dinner here was very poor and totally different from what I would normally expect. Not one to moan at the great staff but felt I had to give this comment.,1
"Terrible servceThank you for your review and I am so sorry to learn your meal was not up to the standard you usually receive when you dine with us.
We are always so confident in the food we serve and I am sure this was an unfortunate rare occasion when we didn't manage to get everything right. Had you mentioned to us that your meal was not up to scratch we would have happily arranged a new steak for you, or offered you something different from the menu. It is always so disheartening for us to read a complaint online when nothing has been brought to our attention at the time to give us a chance to remedy 'the issue'.
It is unfortunate you have decided not to visit us again, however if you do change your mind (and I hope you do) I am certain you will not be disappointed. Customer service is a mainstay at The Wilmington and nothing would please us more than if you would return and let us give you the exceptional experience and food you expect.
We have the same team here with no changes in management or staff and can only apologise again that we did not meet up to your expectations on this occasion.
Our General Manager Johnny will contact you personally to investigate and try to resolve the issue.

"Overall Disappointing VisitWe booked easily for a family supper. Initially we were very impressed with the welcomes, first when we dropped off a birthday cake and secondly on arrival. However here the good service stopped. It took 15 minutes to get a drink (in a pub!), at least 30 minutes to order, a further 20 minutes to be told that one of our orders was off (the fish of the day was already off despite the relatively early hour) and a further 30 minutes to be served the quite good starters. The mains, mainly steak, were cooked as ordered but were lukewarm on cold plates. The wines were good, but with a 4 times mark up before service. Service was charged at 12.5% and I seriously considered not paying it.",2
"Metal staple in food - no compensation offeredThank you for your review and I am extremely disappointed to read your comments.
We take our customer service very seriously and I apologise that on this occasion you did not receive the service we expect all our customers to receive. I will be discussing your comments regarding the service with our Restaurant Manager.
Please accept our apologies that your visit did not meet with your expectations and we hope to have another opportunity to put things right.

"bad service not a good timeWent for a Sunday Roast, my food had a huge metal staple in it that I almost swallowed. I told the waiter, they apologised but didn't offer me anything to compensate for this. A free drink might have been a good idea, given the circumstances. Food was otherwise good.",2
"DisappointingI was very much looking forward to a roast here as a friend had said how epic they are.
We sat down and the roasts were lovely (if a bit shy on veg and potatos..clearly this pub runs out of things and doesn't care to serve meals like that) but we waited ages for staff to actually do things clear the plates ..or ask if we wanted more drinks. Not at one point did anyone ask us if the food was ok. Then came a waiter who asked us if we wanted pudding (we looked at the menu) and when he told us they had run out of something (after making our choices) we let out a disappointed oh and he said we had shouted at him and stormed off. He then stood and slagged us off to his mates. The puddings again had run out of key ingredients and the chefs are happy to send crumble with no topping and charge people £7 ...i won't come back.",2
"Nice refurb!We had high hopes for the Wilmington 69, after walking by it several times...however we were wrong. A nice atmosphere and decor, however food is mediocre and service dismal. Our first visit, it took forever for the server to come over, and again after a long wait for food, it felt like an eternity before we could get the check. Wanted to give it another try hoping we had just been unlucky the first time. Second visit, although nice, the server couldn't answer a single question about the menu. Then she disappeared for the rest of the evening, and we weren't able to get drinks or our check without chasing after another server. Food was nothing to write home about, especially for the price. Plenty of better places in exmouth market or angel.",2
"Would not go backHi Centre521,

Many thanks for taking the time to write a review of The Wilmington. I am very sorry to hear you did not enjoy either of your experiences with us.

When it comes to service, we always strive to give the customer the best experience possible.

Sometimes, if we have an unexpected rush, wait times can be affected, but that's no excuse for both of your visits being tarnished due to delays in service and for this we offer our sincerest apologies.

Our General Manager, Johnny, will write to you personally to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Amelia",2
"Food too salty!This is a nice refurbishment with an open planned restaurant.
The main problem is the temperature it is freezing and detracts from the overall atmosphere whilst trying to cut heating costs, not a wise move.",2

"Great food and great staffOur food was fantastic, amazing roast dinner. However, the service was really poor and which was a real shame as it let the amazing food down. About four in our group had to request our drinks 3-4 times before getting them- and we are pretty patient customers, It was also only around 12:30 so not too busy. We then thought the bill seemed a little pricey, and after checking over it, we found about £80 worth of things none of us had ordered on our bill. Turns out they'd merged the table next doors bill, who had managed to leave without paying for the items. Mistakes happen of course, but there was no apology and we were made to feel awkward for asking them to check the bill.",3
"Average food after a long wait...Hi talialefevre
Thank you for your review and so pleased to learn you really enjoyed your food on your visit to The Wilmington.

"MegWe followed the recommendations on TripAdvisor and arrived there one evening at 9 pm. We had to wait almost 25 mn after having ordered to get our food. Average dishes, without real interest and quite heavy. Definitely a place not worth the 15-mn walk we had to get there.",3
"Nice pub, ok foodOn a January deal (50% off food on Mon/Tues). I booked. Didn't need to. The whole restaurant to ourselves for most of our visit. Like others have mentioned service is poor. When we wanted the bill the three serving staff were having so much of a giggle between themselves we had to shout across the dining room. Food delivery was slow. We'd been persuaded by the manager's description of the oh so delicious market fish. When it came it was overcooked (Lemon Sole en papillote.) I swapped the rosemary fries for glazed carrots. They were clearly not expecting this because despite waiting 40 mins for the fish the carrots were rock hard. I am sure if I'd stuck with the Bun and Cheek as I'd initially planned it might have been better. I noticed the only other table to have customers as we were leaving also had the fish. I bet they were disappointed too. Oversold and underdelivered I'm afraid The Wilmington.",3
"AverageComing expecting more. The waitress was good, the quality of food good but not very delicious. There are better restaurants for lower prices. Overall good comparing with average.",3
"FoodThank you for your review.
We are so pleased to learn you appreciated the service, we take great pride in our team who all strive to give our customers the best experience ever.

"As good as we rememberedWe had a family dinner here a few years ago and as we were returning to the area we thought we would try again.

Early on a Saturday evening the place was almost empty which was a surprise as its such a nice venue.

The staff are lovely and the food well delivered.

We both had the daily special and desert, that plus drinks cost us approx. £44 (we were given the 20% discount on food as we had tickets for Sadlers Wells).

There are a great deal of food venues in this area but to my mind the Wilmington is as good if not better than many of the others.",4
"Great place for a quiet lunchWe had an early lunch here on a Saturday in May. We'd booked a table but it was almost empty at the time so wasn't required so ended up sitting outside which was nice as the road was fairly quiet.
The food was very good and the service was friendly. The menu was more interesting than most gastro pubs.
We'd definitely eat here again if in the area.",4
"Nice and chilled dinner in a nice atmosphereHi cngj

"Excellent food in pleasant surroundingsGreat pub in Clerkenwell! Food, drinks and staff are excellent. We are often looked after by Inma La Guapa and she’s always bubbly, helpful and professional. She does go out of her way to make you feel comfortable.",4
Lovely pubCame here with a group when the world cup was on TV in the Wilmington. Decent atmosphere and I thought the food was really good. I had the pork chop which was a decent size and tasty. The chips which accompanied by neighbour's steak also looked fantastic. Its definitely a step or two above your normal pub food.,4

"Very good but not perfectWe happened upon this place on a filthy wet day and it was just the job for a cosy lunch. The menu had plenty of choice but we all picked the full English, and were able to specify various amendments to each dish. All our requirements were met, and although the food took a little while to arrive, it was piping hot and delicious. Service was friendly throughout, and in addition there was a decent range of alcohol including real ales. The decor and ambience were great too.",4
"Good service and delicious foodHi IndigoStar79
Thank you for your review and delighted to learn that The Wilmington made up for the horrible weather in London that day !
So pleased you all enjoyed the 'Full English', we always try to be as accommodating to everyone's taste as we can be, so if that means swapping or removing items in your meal we will always change where possible.
Good to know you appreciated the service and enjoyed the selection of drinks available.
There is nothing better than a cosy pub with a great atmosphere - fantastic that The Wilmington ticked these boxes for you.
Do hope you will pop back to see us again if in the area.

"Return to The WilmingtonWhat a good place this is! Food, ambience, service, are each excellent.
We shared some crispy squid with a delicious wasabi mayonnaise..then my wife tucked into a delicious burger and chips. I had cod with a superb sauce which included cucumber, ginger, turmeric, and mustard. We go fairly frequently to Sadler's Wells and so we have become acquainted with many of the eateries around Exmouth Market and Roseberry Avenue, and that cod was the single best main I have eaten in that vicinity. It's phenomenal.",5

"Great gastro pubHelping my son move flat, he booked a table as a thank you, and what a thank you it turned out to be. It was Sunday and we all had something off their Sunday Roast menu; my wife and I opted to share the roast beef platter with all the trimmings, which we both agreed was the finest Sunday roast we had ever had from a restaurant. My son and his girlfriend equally enjoyed their roast sirloin and roast chicken and would definitely order these again.

I cannot recommend this pub/dining restaurant too highly, because in addition to the food, the atmosphere is great and the staff incredibly helpful - do try it and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",5

"Football lunchPopped in to my sister's new local one Sat night for a drink... Found the staff very friendly and a drink to please most people. Saw the notice about the Sat 'bottemless brunch' that we could have had earlier, so decided to come back for Sun lunch instead and found it to be a lovely relaxing pub for drinks, browsing through the papers etc. We both ordered the steak carvery...which was very tasty and cooked to perfection. So good in fact I had to celebrate with a sticky toffee pudding! 250 miles away to be my local, but I wish that it was.",5
"Lovely cosy pubHi Adrian P
Wow, what a super review, thank you so much.
Sorry you missed out on our Saturday 'bottomless brunch' but great news that you decided to return the next day for our Sunday Roast. Pleased to know you both enjoyed our steak carvery and well done you for finishing with our famous sticky toffee pudding, what better way to end a meal.
Thank you for your kind comment wishing we were your local, we do hope you will visit us again next time you are in the area.

"Top knotch bottomlessPopped in here whilst the football was on for a quiet Sunday roast ! Excellent food , good serving of hot delicious food ! Great surroundings! Get yourselves down here soon !!!",5
"TerribleHave the owners just abandoned this restaurant? I’m not sure there is any management on site, ever.

Went in for a late-ish breakfast. I mean how long can it take to cook this? And then when the food came out 45 minutes later it had clearly been cooked hours ago. Almost plastic-like. If a chef can’t even cook an egg properly you really have to question their ability to cook anything don’t you?!

The food is stale, tasteless and the cheapest rubbish you’ll ever taste. The service is beyond bad. Do not go here - I can’t say it any clearer.

It got to 11.55am and several groups of people came in, to be told they were ‘temporarily closed’ to set up for lunch. The staff turned away a few hundred quid of orders instead of welcoming them in for a short wait. Lucky for the people!! Maybe they went somewhere decent instead. What sort of restaurant isn’t ready for lunch at 11.55??",1
"Never Again; Food cold, nut not as cold as the management!Visiting the area last night with friends we took a table at this place. The food arrived and in the main was cold; i asked for mine to be changed and waited 20 minutes at which point my friends had all finished and I told them not to bother. The young girl serving was polite, but a little uneasy with the situation. There were a number of members of staff who were older, and amongst them a lady whom you would presume was the manager. Nobody else came to the table with an apology or anything by way of explanation. The place was not busy at the time so no excuses there. Just a really poor dining experience and disappointing that none of the hierarchy seemed bothered.",1
"Poor food, surly staffWe tried it about a year ago and it was awful - my wife told the waitress it was the worst meal she had ever had. We gave it a seined chance recently and it was no better. what food we had was awful but we left before our main course because of the time we waited. The staff were unwelcoming and made no apology for our long wait. We won't be giving it a third chance.",1
"WoefulReally poor. Setting is nice and pleasant l, however it took about 15minutes to get hold of a waiter after being seated. Smoothies horrid. Sweet but watery. Ordered a full English to receive 1 sausage 1 egg and 1 rasher of bacon. Cold and salty. Sent one dish back described as avocado on toast, came as a Canapé about a mouthful in size. Will not be returning. Understaffed and slow.",1
"Our worst meal in LondonHad just visited St. Paul’s and walked by the restaurant and went in for an early dinner. Started off well but went down hill quickly. Ordered sausages and mash and fish and chips so not that complicated. Waiters shift was over so he left but we didn’t know. About 45 minutes later our dinner showed up. Mine was fine but hubbys fish and chips were slimey. As we sat there waiting a manager with short hair and another with a man bun kept walking by us but never checked to see why we were sitting there so long. Oh well. American tourists I guess it doesn’t matter. No refills on drinks, had to ask, had to ask for check had to ask for silverware. Just not a good experience. Tons of better places to chose from. Joe pull your socks up and get your place up to snuff.",1
"Rude and disgusting!Well.. what to say!? We went for lunch at Joe’s Kitchen and my partner wasn’t well, we asked the server to sit away from the door as it was cold outside and I didn’t want him to get any worse, immediately he sat us away from the door and his colleague (blond girl) approached him and told him “I don’t care if he is sick, they sit where we tell them to sit”. We waited almost 25 mins to get a cup of soup.. which ended up to be broth and we had to put some butter to make it eatable and thicker. My “mozzarella bocconcini” were oily and served with pink and tasteless tomatoes. Again the burger came burned with tasteless veggies such as salad, onions and tomatoes. The blond girl never asked if everything was alright, also thank you and please seems to be out of her vocabulary! Never ever again!",1
"Don’t botherWaited nearly an hour for breakfast before giving up and heading to Starbucks next door but one. Extremely poor service and standoffish staff, there are better places in the area",1
"Awful. Terrible, inefficient service and badly prepared food.A group of us went here this week. We had pre-ordered our meals as requested but we still waited 2 hours to receive our starters and mains. Drinks never arrived - we had to chase numerous times. The place was only about a third full and there were plenty of staff but the service was slow and amateurish. Food was served cold and then reheated to a point that it was so dry it was inedible. A shockingly bad experience.",1
"Ruined birthday lunchMy colleagues organised a lunch to celebrate my turning 50, and booked a table here.
We pre-ordered so the restaurant would know what we would be having and we could leave in time for meetings and other work engagements.
We arrived, ordered drinks and the starters and drinks arrived immediately.
Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.
A table by us sat down, ordered, had their food, paid and left.
We still waited,.
After asking the waiter what was happening we were reassured it would be five minutes.
Three times.
After an hour of arriving we had to leave without having our mains.
Thank you for spoiling a nice occasion",1
"Awful serviceWent here for breakfast. Didn’t bring all the drinks out and waited half an hour for a tap water. After constantly asking the waiting staff where our food was, It eventually came after an hour and was cold. Staff didn’t seem bothered at all and every request we made we were told to hold on and then they disappeared. We eventually left and went elsewhere without eating, waste of time. Nice place but needs service improvement.",1
"Pure MSGVery tasty kebab, but I spent 2 hours on the floor afterwards feeling dizzy and sweating. I recognised this as a rection to monosodium glutamate. Do not eat here if you have ever siffered an MSG reaction before.

And it's still ""very tasty"", because that ""umami"" taste from teh MSG does persist...",2
"Wouldn't go again!Pros:

- Ambience/Decor
- Service
- Chips
- Dessert

Cons:

I was trying to eat healthily so ordered chicken skewers without pitta but with extra salad, followed by fruit salad without the honeycomb and icecream

- Cous cous was SUPER dry and inedible
- Salad was lettuce, onion and apple (?). No cucumbers, tomatoes etc...hardly what I call a salad so very disappointing
- Chicken skewers were very plain and somewhat tasteless
- My fruit salad was apples, raspberries and about one strawberry, cut up. Granted I literally ordered a bowl of fruit by I probably got around 2 handfuls of it. Given I had no ice-cream or honeycomb, it would have nice if I had got a bit more fruit! £5.95 for around one cup of fruit was definitely a rip-off

It's a shame as this place has so much potential - the design of the decor is perfect and service is fine but the food was a let down!",2
"Very disappointed in the fish and chipsOur group of about 40 Road Scholar participants had a lunch of fish and chips here. I was looking forward to trying one of the dishes which England is known for. Unfortunately, the meal was not very good. The fish was tasteless and very dry, probably a result of being overcooked. Based on our limited experience, I am surprised to see all the good reviews.",2
"DisappointingUsually have a good meal in this restaurant. However on most recent visit I ordered the fish finger sandwich and it was not nice. The bread seemed stale, and there were only two tiny fish fingers in the bread which were not at all great quality. Unfortunately as we were in a hurry I didn't say anything at the time as I wouldn't have had the time to have a new dish made. Hopefully this was just a bad day",2
"Family visited Joe’sFood was mediocre. ‘‘Twas a very hot day. They charged for each tea refill. The waitress did not answer questions well. She made a significant mistake in our check, but also made it awkward to ask questions about it. All in all, we were overcharged for poor service and strange food. We’re definitely food adventurers, but this was just not a positive experience.",2
Left standing for ages waiting for a tableI was meant to be meeting a friend for breakfast today. I've been here before and liked the place but service today was appalling. One waitress on duty only and she was working her way round tables taking orders whilst I was left standing like an idiot waiting to be seated. So I left.,2
"Great food poor serviceWe waited an hour for food, asked for a dessert menu and they forgot about us so asked someone else for the bill. Foods okay but the service is slow and clearly under staffed.",2
"Not great7 of us ate here (4 adults, 3 children)... it was a Sunday afternoon so not particularly busy but.... all the dishes were ""tepid"" at best but on one dish the veg and sauce was stone cold (chicken stuffed with ricotta), we returned it, but mentioned the chicken was fine and ""not to microwave that if tthey were just going to blast the veg and sauce""... The chicken came back like molten lava and very dry because it was obvious the whole plate had been ""nuked"". Also the kids ""build a burger"" came with nothing to ""build"" just one normal burger cut in half on 2 small broiche buns... we had to ask for the cheese, salad and mayo that was on the menu... one slice of cheese, a slice of tomate and a leaf of lettuce later.... no mayo... gave up...",2
"Dodgy and inconsistentWent with family for Impromptu meal following a trip to Tate Modern. We ordered drinks and main courses of Burger, Chorizo Hash and Katsu Chicken Curry. Due to the Curry being too hot for my daughter, I had to eat this. It was very spiced but only tasted of Peanuts so really very poor. The Chorizo Hash was ok and the burger was swimming in mayo.
All in all very average and consequently very expensive, there are a lot of restaurants to choose from round here so try one of them.",2
"Poor service and foodFirstly, I was rushed to order my food even though I asked for more few minutes. Then, the food took ages to arrive, more than 45 minutes after we ordered it, fact that I don't understand because the restaurant was not full neither busy and we had only ordered one dish each. When my dish finally arrived, I was really dissapointed. I ordered the lamb skewers and the meat was very dry and slightly burnt. The vegetable on the skewer was completely carbonised, I couldn't eat it. On top of that, I found a small hair in between the salad leaves!!. I was never asked if the food was ok, neither offered ketchup for the chips. Very disapointing meal and bad experience. I won't come back again and I don't recommend it.",2
"Breakfast would have been good if eggs cooked properlyOur order took a long time to come out. By the time we received it, the hard boiled eggs were solid in the middle and the fried egg centres were congealed. A let down considering the menu looked great and the dishes well priced.",3
"Lacking a little finesseVisited here with my wife, children, nephew and his fiancé. Quite nice décor and the menu is straightforward with options for kids as well. Ordered beetroot houmous to snack on, it came with pittas and veg, the spring onions that accompanied it had not been cut at both ends so they still had the tough root section which seemed strange. Food arrived and was okay, not outstanding just okay. My bun for my grilled chicken burger was a bit tough, like I said lacking a little finesse in presentation and finishing touches. Service was thin on the ground but the waiter did his best given he had quite a few customers to look after. He was polite and friendly which was a plus. Given the choice of eateries in this location this place is not going to get visited again for a while.",3
"Enjoyed the ambiance, but average meal and average serviceGlad we ran into this little breakfast nook. Menu had a lot of great options and inside was very nicely decorated. Service was friendly but slow. Portions were rather small on some dishes though. Prices are what you would expect for the type of restaurant. Our food did take a very long time, even coffee and tea. We also ordered a side of hash browns that took about 10-15 minutes. Then when we got the bill, the server charged us for 2 orders, and when we told her we only ordered one, she said ""well you ended up eating both anyways so you were charged for both."" It was our first time there so we obviously didn't know how many came to a serving. Especially since it was brought on one plate. She ended up just saying ""it's fine"" and sort of storming away. I enjoyed my company and the food tasted good (except the hollandaise sauce, skip that). Not missing much if you skip it.",3
"Nice atmosphere, decent food, slow serviceThe area immediately around Ludgate Hill is a bit of a culinary wasteland and aside from a couple of options near Blackfriars, it’s generally advised to head east towards Bank or west towards Covent Garden for really good dining options.

But, we found ourselves hungry on a very rainy Friday night, and the hammering rain meant that somewhere very close by was a must. Most options in this area are standard soulless tourist-focussed chains: Pizza Express, Cote, Yo Sushi, McDonalds, Wagamama etc.

Joe’s is very comfortable, homely and snug. Almost hygge. Pleasant lighting and nice decor. We had padron peppers and halloumi to start and chorizo hash and their ‘gourmet burger’ as mains. The food isn’t spectacular but it’s perfectly fine. The burger was surprisingly good for a non-specialist place. The portion sizes for the starters were pretty small (a plate of padron peppers had 11 small peppers for £4.50 - most Spanish restaurants would served more like 30 peppers for that price) but portion sizes were otherwise fine.

The service was pleasant but pretty slow. Other tables looked to have been waiting a very long time. The waiter and waitress serving were covering the entire place between two of they; were working very hard but the place is clearly understaffed.

Not the best place in London but probably the best option on Ludgate Hill. Would I return? I guess so. But only if it was raining heavily.",3
"Ok food and nice serviceVisited for a quick dinner after work. Only had mains (chicken and lamb lifts skewers with couscous). Both were very average, minimal flavour and wouldn’t be difficult to match at home. Service was prompt and polite. Overall nothing to shout about but reasonable on price.",3
Has a high street brand feelCame here with no plan and never heard of it before really is nothing special. Very slow service and food was really average also after three times being told our sandwich was pulled pork they conceded and agreed it was fish finger and changed it another ten minutes sorry I don’t recommend this place,3
"disappointingheard a lot about this place and was looking forward to Christmas dinner,but didn't live up to expectations. waited 30 minutes for our cold starters to arrive and had to remind staff about them,was quite nice when they arrived(prawn cocktail and beetroot houmous)-then christamas dinner arrived-very average-minimum veg,rock hard stuffing balls,not like a home roast dinner I was expecting-to me looked like it could have been hanging around a while-was hungry-so ate it!
then the bill arrived and we were charged 20% service charge!-we queried this and was told that's the norm for the city?-not sure if that's right but considering the standard of the meal-we were not happy! would not go here again or recommend!",3
"Ok food, slow serviceWe visited as a group on a Sunday and enjoyed a table tucked away at the back of the restaurant. While we enjoyed the semi-privacy, I can't help but wonder if our out of the way placement contributed to the slow (albeit friendly) service.",3
"Mix of Good and BadMyself and a friend ate here on a Tuesday evening at about 8pm. The venue is very nice, it's warm and cosy, reminds me a bit of Bill's. We shared a starter of crushed avocado on toasted sour dough, which was really nice. As such I expected the rest of the meal to be as good. I ordered fillet of sea bass and my friend had linguine. The pasta was fine but the sea bass fillet was very disappointing. The fillet was absolutely tiny and a little over cooked. It was supposed to be served with a 'garden pea risotto'. This turned out to be brown rice with some peas on top. I sent it back and the waiter was very helpful, recommending I try the salmon, which I did. In complete contrast this was one of the best pieces of salmon I think I've had, it was really well cooked so was lovely and succulent. So things were back on track. For dessert we ordered waffle and profiteroles to share. The cream in the profiteroles didn't taste very fresh and the orange in the chocolate sauce just made it taste bitter. Then the waffle was tough and seemed stale. It was supposed to be served with whipped cream and all there was was a tiny squirt of spray cream (which I really like, so if there was more I'd have been happy). We couldn't finish them. The waiter was, again, very helpful and one of the deserts was taken off the bill. So overall it was a real mix of good and bad. I wouldn't rush back there but I wouldn't write them off either.",3
GoodGreat service with inventive drinks. Food was average and on the bland side. Open late which always help on a night of drinking.,3
"Very nice “pub grub” mealOur travel group (Road Scholars) had a typical lunch of fish and chips here, meal came here with “mushy peas,” tartar sauce, vinegar, and ketchup. No more wrapped in newspaper. Very hearty meal,fresh, and not too greasy.",4
Nice menu & decorThere is a nice menu here with a good variety. Stopped here for breakfast and was really nice and good service. Coffee was nice and a good size portion. Nice décor throughout,4
"Nice casual dinner near St. Paul'sAfter a long day of crowded streets and sightseeing, Joe's Kitchen was a pleasant discovery - a quiet, relaxed place with a menu containing sufficient variety. We were pleased with our choices, lamb wrap and pulled pork sandwich with side salads. Food quality and presentation were good, and the service was ok. Worth trying if you're in the area near St. Paul's Cathedral and your tummy is saying ""Feed Me""!",4
Lovely start to the dayLimited menu but well prepared and delicious food. Great coffee. Open early enough to get us on our sightseeing way quickly. Omelette was outstanding.,4
"Simple and delicious lunchWe had a family gathering at St Paul’s Cathedral for our sons Ordination and wanted to eat lunch immediately before. The menu had a good variety of dishes at very reasonable prices, including a number of simple dishes. This was exactly what we needed with different dietary requirements. I had pre-booked the table via Trip Advisor and really appreciated the space on the form for additional comments, which I used to ask for quick service due to time constraints. Staff were welcoming and friendly and had read my note and mentioned that. Excellent service. The food arrived promptly. Good size portions and cooked really well. We had a quiet corner table which really helped a family and friends reunion and enabled us to chat easily. This is an excellent find in a key tourist area and we will definitely visit again. Thank you.",4
"Very Good!We went to Joe’s Kitchen for breakfast on a Sunday morning, while staying at the near Crowne Plaza Hotel.
We passed a few times during the weekend, and the food and menu looked good so we wanted to give it a go.
Service was good and attentive,
The Decor was really nice and comfortable,
We ordered the Eggs Benedict and a Suasage and Bacon Roll, with coffee’s. Food came out quickly, Hot and perfect!
Very reasonably priced, and there was no rush to kick us out to turn the table over.
A must visit and we will return for an evening meal next time.",4
"Fast, friendly and effectiveWe had breakfast here and needed a solid start and a quick service so that we could get on with our day. Joe’s was the perfect place. Nice staff, very clean and good food. There was enough on the plate and the coffee was ok. Toilet was very clean and the app were you pay on their web site worked perfectly.",4
"Nice breakfast, friendly staffNice food, not to expensive. We had breakfast, pancakes were a bit dry, but flavour was good, the full Joe's breakfast was great!",4
"Andreas was great!Andreas our server was excellent. Very attentive , helpful and friendly, especially considering our large table and multiple needs. I have allergies and found the online menu and filter useless so I would recommend the old fashioned PDF print out with ingredients - much better. Nevertheless thank you to the chef and Andreas for making this special for us and sorting out the food. If he hadn’t been there I’m certain our experience would have been different. Food was great when it came out but could have been warmer. Appreciate hard getting 9 dishes out at once however.",4
Nice fish and chipsHad a quick dinner at Joe's. I went for good old fish and chips which was delicious. Quite big portion too. They also have draft beers worth checking out.,4
"Mr PedrosoGreat deal! Good food and atmosphere! Special thanks to the staff Camilo, very friendly! My family and I really enjoyed the experience!",5
"Mrs BinatiAdorable lunch time! Wonderful food experience. Great drinks! Totally recommended it. The staff was very nice, special thanks for our waiter Camilo, very friendly helped us with the menu and gave us some informations tips. Great place for lunch! Definitely we are coming back.",5
"Best Meal in London!!This little place served the best meal that I had during my entire 12 day trip to Great Britian! I had the chicken and bacon carbonara linguine and my husband had the sirloin steak. Then, I had the lemon meringue sundae - absolutely delicious!!",5
Absolutely brilliant! Amazing breakfast and dinnerThis is one of my favorite restaurants in London . They can never go wrong from eggs Benedict to chicken curry everything is awesome .,5
"Great findLoved this place, the decor was vintage/industrial. The food was fantastic and the kids loved the crates that the build the burgers came in. We really enjoyed our food, staff were very friendly. Would highly recommend this place for dinner. Too marks.",5
"Perfect colleagues leaving lunchWe were a group of more than 20 people but this was not a problem for the restaurant, we pre ordered and everything was perfect even though a few people cancelled the staff dealt with the orders very well. Our server Ignacio was excellent, he made sure we didn’t have a chance to complain about anything! He was friendly and dealt with everything in a very professional manner, we look forward to booking again! :)",5
Wholesome healthy menu and cozy decorGreat breakfasts that offer classics like porridege and eggs as well as healthy alternatives avacado and toast. Cozy decor with wood tables trinkets on shelves and chandeliers. Great fast service. Near Borough tube.,5
Chorizo mash❤️We came here based on Trip Advisor and we weren’t disappointed. Instead of a long list of fullEnglish variations there are a pleasant selection of different dishes to tempt all palates. I chose the chorizo mash which was excellent. Lovely calm atmosphere and pleasant staff. Price ok for Central London. We will be back.,5
Perfect breakfasts and amazing coffeeThis is a must when in the St. Paul’s area. Great choices for breakfast with the eggs and bubble and squeak are incredible. Service is good and very friendly. A large cooked breakfast and hot drink for two only just over 20 quid. Will definitely return.,5
"Excellent place!The atmosphere was very nice, the lights complimented the music, Anna and Pawel, the servers, were very friendly.",5
"TerribleHave the owners just abandoned this restaurant? I’m not sure there is any management on site, ever.

Went in for a late-ish breakfast. I mean how long can it take to cook this? And then when the food came out 45 minutes later it had clearly been cooked hours ago. Almost plastic-like. If a chef can’t even cook an egg properly you really have to question their ability to cook anything don’t you?!

The food is stale, tasteless and the cheapest rubbish you’ll ever taste. The service is beyond bad. Do not go here - I can’t say it any clearer.

It got to 11.55am and several groups of people came in, to be told they were ‘temporarily closed’ to set up for lunch. The staff turned away a few hundred quid of orders instead of welcoming them in for a short wait. Lucky for the people!! Maybe they went somewhere decent instead. What sort of restaurant isn’t ready for lunch at 11.55??",1
"Never Again; Food cold, nut not as cold as the management!Visiting the area last night with friends we took a table at this place. The food arrived and in the main was cold; i asked for mine to be changed and waited 20 minutes at which point my friends had all finished and I told them not to bother. The young girl serving was polite, but a little uneasy with the situation. There were a number of members of staff who were older, and amongst them a lady whom you would presume was the manager. Nobody else came to the table with an apology or anything by way of explanation. The place was not busy at the time so no excuses there. Just a really poor dining experience and disappointing that none of the hierarchy seemed bothered.",1
"Poor food, surly staffWe tried it about a year ago and it was awful - my wife told the waitress it was the worst meal she had ever had. We gave it a seined chance recently and it was no better. what food we had was awful but we left before our main course because of the time we waited. The staff were unwelcoming and made no apology for our long wait. We won't be giving it a third chance.",1
"WoefulReally poor. Setting is nice and pleasant l, however it took about 15minutes to get hold of a waiter after being seated. Smoothies horrid. Sweet but watery. Ordered a full English to receive 1 sausage 1 egg and 1 rasher of bacon. Cold and salty. Sent one dish back described as avocado on toast, came as a Canapé about a mouthful in size. Will not be returning. Understaffed and slow.",1
"Our worst meal in LondonHad just visited St. Paul’s and walked by the restaurant and went in for an early dinner. Started off well but went down hill quickly. Ordered sausages and mash and fish and chips so not that complicated. Waiters shift was over so he left but we didn’t know. About 45 minutes later our dinner showed up. Mine was fine but hubbys fish and chips were slimey. As we sat there waiting a manager with short hair and another with a man bun kept walking by us but never checked to see why we were sitting there so long. Oh well. American tourists I guess it doesn’t matter. No refills on drinks, had to ask, had to ask for check had to ask for silverware. Just not a good experience. Tons of better places to chose from. Joe pull your socks up and get your place up to snuff.",1
"Rude and disgusting!Well.. what to say!? We went for lunch at Joe’s Kitchen and my partner wasn’t well, we asked the server to sit away from the door as it was cold outside and I didn’t want him to get any worse, immediately he sat us away from the door and his colleague (blond girl) approached him and told him “I don’t care if he is sick, they sit where we tell them to sit”. We waited almost 25 mins to get a cup of soup.. which ended up to be broth and we had to put some butter to make it eatable and thicker. My “mozzarella bocconcini” were oily and served with pink and tasteless tomatoes. Again the burger came burned with tasteless veggies such as salad, onions and tomatoes. The blond girl never asked if everything was alright, also thank you and please seems to be out of her vocabulary! Never ever again!",1
"Don’t botherWaited nearly an hour for breakfast before giving up and heading to Starbucks next door but one. Extremely poor service and standoffish staff, there are better places in the area",1
"Awful. Terrible, inefficient service and badly prepared food.A group of us went here this week. We had pre-ordered our meals as requested but we still waited 2 hours to receive our starters and mains. Drinks never arrived - we had to chase numerous times. The place was only about a third full and there were plenty of staff but the service was slow and amateurish. Food was served cold and then reheated to a point that it was so dry it was inedible. A shockingly bad experience.",1
"Ruined birthday lunchMy colleagues organised a lunch to celebrate my turning 50, and booked a table here.
We pre-ordered so the restaurant would know what we would be having and we could leave in time for meetings and other work engagements.
We arrived, ordered drinks and the starters and drinks arrived immediately.
Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.
A table by us sat down, ordered, had their food, paid and left.
We still waited,.
After asking the waiter what was happening we were reassured it would be five minutes.
Three times.
After an hour of arriving we had to leave without having our mains.
Thank you for spoiling a nice occasion",1
"Awful serviceWent here for breakfast. Didn’t bring all the drinks out and waited half an hour for a tap water. After constantly asking the waiting staff where our food was, It eventually came after an hour and was cold. Staff didn’t seem bothered at all and every request we made we were told to hold on and then they disappeared. We eventually left and went elsewhere without eating, waste of time. Nice place but needs service improvement.",1
"Afternoon tea- sugar overload!Tea variaty was great, and green tea was superb! Sandwiches were ok, same taste like sandwich from waitrose, tuna, salmon, egg.. Quite boring..
Than 4 scones and 10cakes for 2 people, thats too much sugar, would prefer some fruit like strawberries, blueberries, raspberries to replace some of the cakes, one had very strong taste of something strange and too much of creams in cakes.
Waitress always came in wrong time and couldnt understand her because of the foreign strong accent, then she came with birthday cake which was a nice suprise, but just put it down on the table and didnt even say happy bday, which was a bit odd.
She needs some customer service training! She was not pleasent at all.",2
"Disappointing afternoon teaHaving been here a few times before, I was so pleased when this was gifted to me by a client. However, on this occasion, I was really disappointed with my afternoon tea experience.

I'm afraid the service was really poor. We had to wait 45 minutes before our first plate of sandwiches arrived, even after asking twice. Even after they eventually arrived, we had to keep asking for more whereas previously, they were simply replenished as you finished them. What annoyed me even more was that some other tables received good service... just not us. Waiters would frequently just walk past us despite empty plates and tea pots. We also had to asked THREE times before we received a second tea pot.

Service aside.... the quality of the actual product has really diminished. During previous visits, sandwiches were generously filled but on this occasion, it was a feeble smear of a filling. This is the first time I left a Mandarin Oriental afternoon tea feeling hungry.

For the cash value of this gift, I was very disappointed and won't be returning. A real shame as I used to love afternoon tea here :(",2
"dreadful afternoon tea experienceMy husband, son (aged 7), father in law (mid 80s) and I booked for afternoon tea here. Taking afternoon tea is a hobby of ours .. We had been in London to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the theatre. We thought that we would “make a day of it” in the city. We selected the hotel because we had only returned from Bangkok 2 weeks earlier and had taken afternoon tea in the Authors Lounge in the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok on the 12th August and it had been outstanding.

We arrived on time 5.30 pm and were shown to our table. We cannot fault the staff throughout our meal, they were delightful. The venue is also very pleasant and the table setting and crockery were lovely.

Despite my positive comments about the staff and environment from there things went downhill

We sat down and asked for 3 adult afternoon teas and an apple juice for our son. We explained that 3 teas were more than enough between all of us and our son would just share our food. At this point our lovely waitress started to look worried. She said that our son had to have a child’s afternoon tea and that he couldn’t share our food. We said that we felt there was more than enough food for all of us with 3 adult afternoon tea stands (having looked at the menu online and at the tables around us) and we were happy to share with him. We have never encountered this before, so didn’t think it could be a problem. The waitress then said, that if this was the case we couldn’t have any “top ups” of sandwiches, cakes etc if he was choosing to share our food. No problem we replied, the amount of food, as advertised on the menu, for each person was more than enough. She then looked really worried and said she “didn’t think this was allowed” and that she would need to speak to her manager.

Her manager, again charming, came over and said that If our son wanted to share our food then she couldn’t allow us any top ups of food and she would have to charge us £7 for every pot of tea we drank. By this time, having not eaten since breakfast, perhaps it added to the confusion, we were now completely befuddled. “Fine” we say, “that’s fine. 3 adult afternoon teas, 2 pots of tea and an apple juice”. The manager now squats down beside me and says “please I need to charge you for 3 pots of tea and 3 adult afternoon teas, please just buy a child’s afternoon tea. He cannot eat from your afternoon tea plates.”

It is now 5.55 pm. We are now in the completely ridiculous situation of being held to ransom at our table over a £30 child’s afternoon tea (food we do not want), even though we are about to spend over £150 on food. The situation is clearly getting embarrassing for all around, we are starving hungry and so just capitulate and tell her to just serve us what she is allowed to serve us. We think things can get no worse. How wrong we were.

The tea arrives in a tea pot, no tea strainer we note, how interesting. We taste the tea, it tastes stewed and not good. We open the tea pot to find no tea leaves (and thankfully no bags) and are left completely confused how our tea is being produced. The tea brought to us through the whole service was incredibly variable in what it tasted like or its temperature.

We are then served our sandwiches 3 of each flavour and some very sad looking cakes, 2 different types 6 in total on one stand. I have to tell you the sandwiches were the worst I have ever encountered in an afternoon tea. I’m not sure how old they were, but they had been made some time before serving. The bread tasted cheap and nasty and the fillings were worse. The beef tasted like a cheap paste, the egg and cucumber sandwiches under seasoned and the fish and crab ones, poorly flavoured and tasting like cheap crab sticks. I had one of each flavour and that was enough for me. My husband and father in law both large chaps over 6 ft and starving both thought they would try and second of each thinking perhaps a second plate would be fresher, it was no better they told me.

Bravely we moved onto the cakes – still no wiser as to where our pastries and scones were. Personally I prefer to eat my pastries next but clearly they were not forthcoming. What I think was the mandarin and almond cake was inedible, the thick layer of what I think was butter icing, completely overwhelmed the cake underneath. One mouthful was enough for me. I managed 2 mouthfuls of the frangipane before giving it up as a bad job. My husband and father in law were similarly unimpressed. Luckily for my son, his versions never even turned up.

A waiter than offered to bring the scones and pastries. Hurrah we thought, finally we get to see the best part of an afternoon tea. He brought 6 scones and 4 pastries. My father in law tried one scone and announced he had had enough, he wasn’t going to even try the pastries. At the time we thought this was lucky as we only had to cut them in half rather than into 3. How very odd we buy 3 afternoon teas but only get pastries for one person. The pastries looked and tasted like a sea of brown. Nothing exciting or fresh, although I think I may of actually tasted gooseberry at one point. The whole meal was an utter let down, and what of my son and his afternoon tea. As predicted he ate the grand total of 4 sandwiches, the 2 mini scones and the little silver balls in a shot glass. What a waste of food.

I had no opportunity to give feedback at the time as during the entire service not one person asked us how the meal was. The hotel is letting down the brand of Mandarin Oriental with its current offerings.

We wrote to the manager of the hotel and were told that the staff decided how long the tea would be brewed for as apparently customers are unable to do this. He was utterly unrepentant about how awful the food had been and basically sent us a standard fob off letter. I was so disappointed with the whole experience. Do yourselves a favour and go and have afternoon tea at the Millennium down the road a much nicer experience",2
"Nice afternoon tea in ok setting, poor service1st of January 6 pm afternoon tea. Mixed Caucasian and West Indians/french party. Other guests were of Arabian/Mediterranean and Japanese descent.

We we seated ok and greeted by junior waiter who took orders for water and champagne and tea. We received water and Champagne and then saw nothing of him for the next 30 minutes - no tea and no pastries.

2 other parties who came after us were served in full. Obviously we were not orientals so maybe we were lesser people?

Finally the only female in the staff took care and saw to it that we were served. She understood our irritation and offered extra champagne. Then serving went well and the eateries were nice and the tea selection wide and for all tastes.
The service charge was removed but I left some tip on the table.
The decoration in this room (not the Rosebery, and clearly not my first choice - Claridges, Ritz, Savoy, Brown's were unavailable) is sparse and did not give a festive impression nor a feeling of top notch venue. That, together with the lackluster service make me not wanting to recommend this at all.
The female waitress' intervention was the only redeeming aspect.",2
"Ms LMcAHad afternoon tea here last week . Room is v mediocre , prices are high and service exceedingly poor . Should have asked for money back as such a disappointment on service front .",2
"afternoon tea for out of town visitorsThe wait staff was friendly, polite and welcoming however there was no continuity in service. I don't believe we had the same waiter serve us twice in 2 hours. We had to ask for a second and third cup of tea which never arrived hot or on time. There was no timing and pairing of food and tea. Sometimes we had food and no tea or tea and no food. They really had no idea of the culture of proper English tea service. The overall afternoon tea experience was disappointing making it feel expensive.",2
"Evening Tea - odd concept which doesn't quite workThey call it evening tea but really it's just afternoon tea served at evening time (in case you were wondering if there was anything different). It was a little sad as we were the only ones in the room having tea. Anyway, as teas go, this one is mediocre. Too many sweet pastries which we couldn't finish and the scones were just so-so. Will not be going back.",2
"Terrible birthday Afternoon TeaThe setting was stunning and i had a 10/10 service at the spa. So i was expecting the same for afternoon tea...
What a disappointment. The service was abysmal. In taking 25mins to deliver a plate of tiny sandwiches. And waiting for tea for over 15 minutes. Definitely, wouldn't recommend have had better in London.
Especially not for your birthday
The plate below took 20 mins to prepare.",2
"The worst afternoon teaYou would think a five star hotel with the reputation of the Mandarin Oriental would be able to provide a five star afternoon tea. Perhaps it is the arrogance of their reputation that they feel customers should be grateful to be there or perhaps they just don't care. The service experienced was appalling having to wait what seemed like forever for teas and coffees to arrive both the original order and replenishments. And the staff coming at you from all sides without notice to place or remove things from the table which was so small they had to juggle things around. Adding to this staff kept on bumping into my chair several times and my friend was hit in the face by a plate when it was being removed from the table.
As to the food it was nice but meagre with undersized sandwiches and cheap scones and a patisserie selection that lacked as much imagination as it did flavour.
There are several much better places for afternoon tea in London than the Rosebery.",2
"Poor reception staffWent in to get a gift voucher for Christmas present for afternoon tea.
The staff on reception didn't know the price of afternoon tea - one told me to ask in the lounge!!!! The other offered to look it up on the Internet. I asked the price for a champagne tea- they didn't know - I had to go through to the lounge to get the price myself !!!

Then it took 2 attempts to put the sale through. Then the man on reception had to get assistance - by this time I wished I had gone to the Berkley instead. Eventually I got the voucher - a painful experience.

The reception staff need better product knowledge & customer service skills. Let's hope afternoon tea is good & the gift voucher was worth the wait!",2
"Service was super!Staff are very attentive and helpful. Afternoon tea portion is good, pastry are well made, full of cream, disappointed with scones, small and hard. Environment is very comfortable and relax.",3
"expectations not metI went twice in two weeks, the first time I thought the person in charge, he seemed to be anyway, was not on the ball, not smiling, not really happy to be there.
First impressions, not so good.
We ordered afternoon tea or teas and cakes but I had to call for the order to be taken, Now this hotel prides itself in serving people from the middle east, they should know they do not like to wait and it was long, hot drinks served promptly but not the food on both occasions.
Fortunately I grabbed a waitress, Suisse and she was much more switched on , she really seemed to care, she definitely made me want to return again.
As for the food, it was good but the cakes are way too big, they are usually shared and it is not easy, more cakes but in small size would be great.
I would still recommend the Mandarin, the room is gorgeous and the atmosphere is nice.",3
"Wonderful Food with Poor ServiceFirst of all the hotel is undergoing what appears to be a major structural refurbishment, so we were initially greeted by tonnes of scaffold. This of course meant The Rosebury was in fact a makeshift facility to the rear of the hotel and not The Rosebury as we know it. A big disappointment. Food was very good, as ever, but the service was slow to the extreme. Ruined the whole experience as you had to order tea about 15 minutes before you actually wanted it. All in all this was a poor visit; and the pricing remains at the extreme end of high + service charge which I find dishonest given the circumstances. I won't be rushing back - regrettably.",3
"Nice but not worth the money and had betterBefore choosing to book afternoon tea at the Roseberry, my friend and myself researched the venue online. We look at a handful of reviews and photographs of the venue, room and the food of course!

Once we arrived at the hotel, we were surprised at how old the interior of the main reception looked. No-one greeted us and we had to find our own way to the Roseberry Room. Upon finding the room, we were promptly sat at a table and was explained to how the menu worked. How we could have as many sandwiches and scones as we liked and endless pots of tea.

However, during our 2 hours that we were there, we were probably served by over 8 different members of staff. Each and every member of staff was particularly helpful and friendly, but you really had to catch their attention. We were left for long periods in between where we would have ordered more tea.

It actually got to the point where I had to put my hand up (like in school) to get someones' attention. It was as if we had been forgotten about.

Saying that, the food was nice and the tea was gorgeous (even if they never did bring up the milk that I requested to be on the side!!)

Very pricey for what you get, we opted for the normal afternoon tea without cocktails and with service charge it was £60 pp. I've had afternoon tea at the Ritz for less than this and if I had to choose, I would most certainly choose the Ritz afternoon tea over this one.

The room also didn't have views of Hyde Park, which it advertises, very disappointing. I could see Knightsbridge tube station and that was all.",3
"Average foodWe went there for afternoon tea, five adults and one child.

It was a very elaborate menu which delighted me. Cakes, sandwiches and savoury scones. Yums me thinks.

Sadly, for me the food wasn't as 5 star as i would have expected served at a 5 star hotel. As i mentioned, the menu was elaborate however the taste of most of the desserts are mediocre. Don't get me wrong, the food filled the table as all of us were required to take the afternoon tea. No ala carte option available.

Apart from the scones, the pattiseries are all French which are delicate and good looking but the taste is unfortunately not there. No finesse as you would find in French desserts.

As all of us had to take the afternoon tea, we had to pack about half of it away as it was too much for us.

Personally, it is not a good value for money. The taste is non existence. The room is definitely beautiful. The service is acceptable.

There are better options for afternoon tea in London.",3
"Afternoon teaBooked afternoon tea at the Rosebery with family and friends. Disappointed in the service and tea offering. Paid £62 per head for afternoon tea with rare tea selection and between four of us where given just two different teas. We asked the waiter for his recommendation and considering we paid an extra £10 per head on the normal tea price would have expected a few more teas to be offered. The food itself was good, nice fresh sandwiches and some lovely cakes and pastries. Looked after by two differnt waiters who did explain the menu but felt they were simply going through the motions and offered no real customer engagement. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the design of the room well thought through. Considering the price we paid £300 for four and the standard of the hotel, left feeling underwhelmed by the offering.",3
"late night supper.bland atmosphere ok food, very pricey average wine. Ok for what it was. We will go to Hestons place next time.",3
"Lovely setting but expensiveHad the Afternoon Tea, Sandwiches were tiny, not a great selection of cakes, scones were good, but not great value for money, a little disappointed.",3
"Tea time.Came here for a work breakfast, service was good and the food was OK, lovely setting and great place to have a serious conversation.",3
"Afternoon tea a bit disappointingLovely surroundings for a traditional tea time treat. Food wasn't anything particularly innovative but still tasty nonetheless. My guest went dairy free and I was disappointed that her food was mainly fruit in different guises-on sticks, in pots or covered in chocolate. Service was on the slow side. Doggy bags were requested but they even added a piece of cake that had collapsed on the plate- made a right mess of the box before I got home so not a lot of care was taken there. For afternoon tea there are other places that are better value and quality. Sorry, I so wanted to rave about it.",3
"Really nice afternoon teaService is excellent at The Rosebery Lounge. The afternoon tea was lovely, we enjoyed the sandwiches more than the cakes but that was just personal choice. It was all tasty and beautifully presented. Worth a visit and we will be back.",4
"High tea here is niceHigh tea here is a pleasant experience, but it’s nothing too special. You’re not attended to as much in the Mandarin London as you are at other hotel ‘high tea’ bookings. This approach of having to find your waitress/waiter, rather than them over-attending to you, may suit some people. I will certainly come back to high tea here because it’s in a convenient location, and I am a fan of the Mandarin Oriental brand.",4
"Delicious afternoon teaWe had a lovely afternoon here having the festive afternoon tea. Great service, no rushing, as much food as we wanted. As well as the traditional scones we had delicious festive battenburg, chocolate log and snowball dessert. Brilliant location too for a pre or post shop.",4
"Remarkable!My three friends and I booked this as a treat as we hadn't seen each other in ages. We had a 3pm table but it wasn't ready so we just sat in the lounge. We were then seated half an hour later and as a apology they gave us a complimentary glass of champagne each. I thought this was a fabulous touch (we didn't complain about having to wait). They were informed about dietary requirements and they are double chucked this.
The staff are great they even encourage you to order unlimited of anything you want. You can get coffee, tea and hot chocolate. They replenish your tea as many times as you want and you can change this. I lived their afternoon blend. We must have tried all their teas between the four of us!
The sandwiches and patisserie come out first. The sandwiches are the best I've had in all the afternoon teas I've been to, really innovative and moreish. Yes they are tiny but you can order as much as you want. The lemon curd, rose jelly and strawberry jam served with the scones are truly a bad. However the tin scones themselves were a let down very small and doughy.
The patisseries... although they look the part weren't that impressive. A let down really. We did outstay our time and it became evident in the change of attitude from the staff (from starting off warm and friendly, to being cold and uninviting). But to be fair they didn't ask us to leave we just got that impression.
Overall I loved my time in this lovely dining room and the sandwiches are spectacular. I gave it four stars as the cakes and scones were pretty average. For an establishment like this I'd expect something alot to more spectacular.",4
"Afternoon TeaWe arrived to find the front of the hotel swathed in scaffolding, so it was quite a circuitous way to the front desk. However, everyone was helpful and happy to lead the way. We had Afternoon tea booked in the Rosebery Lounge, but couldn't get a reservation until 5pm so we stopped in the bar first and had a delicious cocktail, a Corryvreckan (gin based with apple and citrus flavours) that I would highly recommend.

The Afternoon Tea was served in the sumptuous Rosebery lounge, the decor was elegant and the ambience relaxed. The food was mixed. Delicious sandwiches and nice cakes, but the scones had a slight baking soda aftertaste and the combination of cream and lemon curd was just odd (there was also strawberry jam and rose jelly). Everything had complimentary refills, although there was a bit of a wait when we asked for more sandwiches. The tea menu was extensive and there were extra teas that incurred a supplementary charge.",4
"A nice cup of teaMy husband and I had an cozy afternoon tea at ""The Rosebery Lounge"". It was a pleasure to try out several types of tea and the staff had great knowledge about the different types. The food was also very good. The only negativ thing was that the chairs and sofa were very soft to sit comfortably in.",4
"A very good high tea indeed, but atmosphere and value disappoint.Couldn't have picked a worst time to stop by the Mandarin for tea. Due to construction, we entered through a side entrance into a dark space (not at all resembling a hotel lobby) and were subsequently led through a long narrow corridor to the main lobby - which was very dark since the windows were all closed off. On entering the lounge, it was much smaller than its appearance depicted on the website (not to mention the windows were closed due to the construction so there was no natural sunlight). The host was very friendly and inviting, as was the rest of the wait staff who were all very attentive and helpful. The interior decor is elegant and the seats were comfortable. The desserts, sandwiches and scones (with three choices of jam) were impressive and yummy delicious! One of the best we've had in the UK! The tea menu is extensive with fresh brews and all the refills you can muster. Did I mention refills of all the food are also free? I suppose that should be expected given the not inexpensive fare of £53 per person. In summary, it's a very good high tea indeed but the overall experience suffers due to the lack of natural light in the lounge - there are only a few windows and they look out on the busy street. At this price it is not unreasonable to expect a far nicer atmosphere. There are many other establishments in London that serve a good high tea with nicer atmospheres and better value.",4
"Christmas afternoon teaWe visited the Mandarin Oriental for afternoon tea as we read great things, and had heard it won an award for the best contemporary afternoon tea. I was a tiny bit disappointed that we hadn't been informed there was a Christmas menu, as I was looking forward to trying the menu we had seen before we booked. However, 4 plates of sandwiches in, my disappointment was forgotten. I'm more of a savory fan than sweet, my partner has more of a sweet tooth, but we were both blown away by the sandwiches. If we'd only had 1 plate, I think we'd have perhaps gone home hungry, but the waiters were more than happy to keep bringing more plates out for us. We both really enjoyed mpst of the sweets, but probably would have preffered the standard menu - we both really wanted to try the muille feuille, so it is worth checking that the menu online is the one they will serve if there is something you particularly want to try. That aside, we left fully satisfied after a lovely afternoon.",4
"An inpromtu breakfastAn impromptu breakfast with my daughter .
Really gorgeous surroundings and lovely view as we sat in one of the huge window tables
Food fabulous ordered pancakes fresh juice smoothie and tea
Lovey staff but ..
Slow service - had to go find a member of staff to pay !",4
"Wonderful afternoon teaWe have been to most of the top hotels for afternoon tea and this is right up there with the best! Everything was delicious and the staff were really lovely.

The only thing that stops me giving 5 stars is the fact that me and my sister do not drink tea and all the other places we have been to let us substitute this for a soft drink. We explained on arrival that we do not drink tea and could we have a soft drink instead and were told we could have anything we wanted (I suppose we should have asked if we needed to pay for this but as we hadn't anywhere else we just assumed we wouldn't here!). So you an imagine how shocked we were to have to pay an extra 26 pounds each on top of what was already an expensive AT for 4 tiny bottles of cokes each!!!!!

Anyway apart from that we did have a lovely time but probably won't return as having to pay for drinks on top of an expensive treat already really isn't ideal!",4
What a way to have High TeaGreat food and service and lots of fun watching the people go by on the stree ask for a window table.,5
Afternoon teaWell what an amazing experience. Fabio our waiter was brilliant and friendly. He made everything seem like it was not effort and exquisite service. I didn’t want to leave. My friends birthday was the best. Thank you.,5
"Lovely placeLovely place for lunch, great location near all the fancy shops, Enjoyed our food and drinks, Staff very polite and great service overall, Was very busy when we came, but we got where to sit:) Nice desserts and good coffee, Would recommend!",5
"The staff make the place!I have never received a better level of customer service, anywhere in the world, ever! Everything else was alright.",5
"Lovely afternoon teaWe had a lovely afternoon tea with our two children (8 & 10yrs). We chose the Rosebery Lounge because we wanted an afternoon tea which the adults could enjoy (with Champagne and wine pairing), had a good vegetarian offering and also had a children’s provision.

There is a great selection of tea. The waiter made a few suggestions and answered our questions, showing good knowledge of how the tea was harvested. The children had Valrhona hot chocolate.

The sandwiches were yummy - the vegetarian option had a good range of sandwiches. My husband doesn’t like egg and has never had an egg sandwich, but enjoyed the egg and truffle sandwich! The children loved the sandwiches apart from the peanut butter and jam (they would have preferred just jam). Extra sandwiches were readily available.

The scones were perfectly made. We enjoyed the lemon curd and rose jelly as well as traditional jam and cream. The children had mini scones with tubes of jam and cream - they loved the novelty of squeezing the cream and jam onto their scones. Also with the children’s scones was a shot glass of chocolate popping candy - another big hit!

The cakes were delicious, although we couldn’t manage to eat all of them so they were packaged up for us to take home. The children had a panda bento box containing kiwi, pancake sandwich, a panda bear cookie and marshmallow “sushi” and a chocolate bear lolly - they loved the presentation and the selection. The children were able to take home the bento box which was a nice surprise. We will definitely reuse it.

This is an afternoon tea that you won’t go home hungry - you can have as many sandwiches, scones and cakes as you like. We enjoyed the warm hospitality and carefully thought out menu offering. Thanks to all the attentive staff, including Fabio, who was a delightful young man.",5
"Great scones, remarkable service - Fabio is amazingJust a quick, craved for a scone tea, great choice that I subscribed to MO Rosebery Lounge. The young gentleman name Fabio who served me was remarkable. Young, passionate and most importantly his kindness and authenticity was truly amazing. Well done to the management team to bring this new blood to the hospitality world. Please make sure you groom them well because the happier they are, the happier your guest would be.",5
"elegant afternoon teaWe did afternoon tea at the Rosebery on a Saturday afternoon; our second place to try tea during our stay in London. The lounge is a very nice, formal sort of room, but very comfortable. It was quite busy when we were there, although we had been able to get reservations on line that morning. The tea itself was good, though the sandwhiches and pastries were not significantly better than ones we had at the St. Ermin a few days before ( I have to say, however, that I am no gourmet so probably should ot pronounce on food at all ). What makes the Rosebery stand out, to me, is that the service is as good as anything you could imagine. They are wonderfully attentive without being intrusive; always there when you need something or are ready for something else; all delightful people. The other thing that makes it stand out is that they offer an option to pair the 3 courses of food with either 3 different beers or wine. I tried the beer ad my wife the wine and it was spectacular. If you go you shold definitely give it a try. It is on the expensive side, but completely worth the overall experience.",5
"High Tea experience was exceptional!There was live music, company was great and everything was magnificent. The hardest thing to do is choose which tea to have. The tea and the tea sandwiches stimulated the senses. The high tea experience in the Mandarin Oriental in Hyde Park is a must experience!",5
"Fabulous afternoon tea!I took my friend here for a birthday treat. What a lovely place! The staff were so friendly the service excellent we felt so special! I had gluten free, I have to say the nicest gluten free sandwiches and cakes I have ever tasted. The Roseby Lounge is a place to relax and enjoy. I must go back, thank you to all the staff who made us feel so welcome.",5
"afternoon teaImpeccable service, lovely presented sandwiches ,cakes and scones. Clean and comfortable lounge. we had a lovely relaxing time and thank you to all staff who served us on Monday 26/2.we will be back for sure.",5
"Anywhere but here!We ate here on our last night in London of a mid week break, the place looked promising and we were really looking forward to it. Well it was a disaster. Our dishes were totally boring and greasy and the service was slow. We asked the waiter where one of the dishes was (focaccio bread) and he said 'you already got it'! which we clearly didn't and we pointed this out so he brought it at the very end. It then appeared on our bill which was even more annoying. Honestly there are other places in South Ken that have far better food and service.",1
AWFULI was brought by trip advisor to this restaurant unfortunately the distasteful experience I had there turned me off a big time. As I arrived with my brother I was trying to ask for a table for two. The waitress there replied me with very bad English saying we are in a complete mess (can't believe that I am now in England!). I didn't get the meaning and was trying to ask if there is a table for two. She was just kept shaking her head without saying a word. My advice to the restaurant would be is if you are hiring a non English speaking person perhaps you should not put her right at the entrance. I was then kind of chased away as she claimed we are very busy at the end. I will not recommend this restaurant at all and will not ever come back despite how tasteful it claims by trip advisor over here. AWFUL!,1
"Do not bother if you just want a glass of wineThank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. I am very disappointed with the experienced you encounter in Apero.
Please rest assured this matter has been addressed and I have also spoken to the team to improve on communication and improve on how these situations are dealt with.
I hope you will allow us an opportunity to restore your faith in us, should you choose to return do not hesitate to contact me directly as I would be delighted to assist you.

Kind regards,

Thomas",1
"Food very ordinaryWe dropped into the hotel around 13.30 hrs on a Wednesday and asked if we could just have a glass of wine. We were guided to go downstairs to the restaurant. In the restaurant most tables had a reservation sign however we were guided to a table after asking for only a drink. The restaurant was mainly empty. After a few minutes another waitress, possibly the restaurant manager, came and told us we could not just have a drink and told us to go back upstairs to the coffee lounge for a drink.

I explained that we had been told to go down stairs if we wanted a drink as the ground floor lounge only served coffee. She seemed surprised and not concerned to help us.

Clearly poor communication and lack of sound management or staff training.

A little effort on the part of the staff could have avoided us giving this Very Poor rating.",1
"Watch out for the squid ink risotto!we went to this restaurant because the decor looked interesting in a recent magazine. Although the staff was very nice, the food was really average if not below average. The menu is strange. The 4 dishes we had lacked any real taste and in fact we only had a few bites of each since they just were not good. The salad dressing tasted like it came out of a bottle. it felt like they worked hard on the presentation but missed on the taste. I think they should revamp the menu. The crowd is basically people staying at the hotel. So it isn't drawing in people from the neighborhood. We live in the area so we were hoping for a new bar/restaurant - but I believe this will stay a hotel restaurant…..mostly for tourists. We ordered …two salads, the gnocchi, and the scallops.",1
"Won't go againDistracted service and cold food it's the worst experience you could have in a restaurant especially when your bill is over £130 for 2, with one bottle of wine and some tapas dishes. No recommended",2
"Disappointing second timeSecond time at this hotel. The room was very small and could not fit two people. Luckily we did not spend too much time at the hotel. The service at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was rather poor. As a member of SLH, I will choose another hotel where I am in London next time.",2
"L'AperoI went to L'Apero with a groupe of friends last Saturday. The quality of food was OK, but we where all disappointed by the small portions and the bill. Way too expensive for what you get.",2
"Very disappointing afternoon teaDear Romyrsf,

Thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit to Apero.
I am sorry you were disappointed by the portion sizes, as the menu style is a sharing plates menu the portions are smaller to enable you to order a variety of dishes. Whilst we have an a la carte menu we also offer a 3 course sharing menu for two with the chef's selection for £32.00 per person which we hope is good value.
I have shared your comments with the food and beverage team for review. Thank you for your comments as we will utilise to make improvements.

Kind regards
Roberto",2
"Maybe decent for turists, not for LondonersI really hate to write bad reviews because I don't come on trip advisor to slag off places but this hotel did disappoint me. Firstly I have to say that the room that we took tea in was dirty. The rug was badly stained as were the fabric on the sofas which was a shame because the room was decorated quite nicely and secondly it was really off putting.
We had the science afternoon tea which was not amazing. The sandwiches were not sandwiches at all but choux pastry with savoury fillings. The cakes unmemorable and the whole experience was for me flawed because the theme suggested that the afternoon tea would be kid friendly yet when I asked if we could get a children's size afternoon tea it was met with a resounding 'no' and the 'sandwiches' were clearly made beforehand as it did not go unnoticed that ours took forever to come out because we had to request that they not put mustard etc on some of the sandwiches. They did not tell me that this would be a problem despite me telling them when I booked that I would have a 6 year old child with us. I wouldn't recommend this place, pay a bit more and go for an afternoon tea in one of the 5 star hotels.",2
"I won't be back!Had an appointment in the area and decided to try it for dinner with my girl tonight and must say I felt very disappointed as most reviews are pretty good. The place is actually ok, cocktails pretty good. Service is decent, but not memorable - waiter don't seem to know much the menu. But the problem is the food: bland - almost tasteless - uninmaginative, basic. I felt I could be cooking it....for 40£ per head (no wine) i would expect much more. Maybe ok for turists, but Londoners are spoilt for good restaurants these days and this is not one of those....",2
"Interesting menu .BUTInteresting breakfast menu. We went there for a different English breakfast - not residents of the hotel. I was disappointed. Yes the basement restaurant is easy to miss on the street, The premises very clean. But the food did not reflect the menu.",3
"Lovely cocktailsThe atmosphere and surroundings were lovely. Quirky touches with original lighting. The cocktails and attentive staff showed promise. The meal itself, a variety of dishes to cater for our party of meat eaters and vegetarians was mediocre and uninspiring which was the point of the evening so disappointing to say the least.",3
"Good cocktails but atmosphere lackingI visited Apero recently with my partner for his birthday. We went for some early evening cocktails around 4 o'clock and were the only people in the bar which was absolutely fine. However the atmosphere was completely ruined as the cleaners proceeded to vacuum the bar, tables and chairs around us whilst we were having our drinks. The noise made it difficult to have a conversation and the atmosphere was pretty awkward. The cocktails and service were great though so without the vacuum cleaning I'm sure it's a great bar!",3
"MeetingFirst time at the hotel for a meeting, and first impressions excellent as I was greeted by the doorman and Manager. Asked where I needed to be, I was shown the bar area.

Bar staff and lunch menu staff very attentive and I explained I had a meeting later.

When I was mid flow in the meeting and with number of others at the bar, a lady decided to start hoovering.....not ideal when having a meeting or when having an end of day drink I'd imagine!!!

Complete lack of realisation that this wasn't wanted and the people I was meeting were far from impressed!

Hoping next time I visit that the good first, and second impressions in the bar, aren't overridden by a hoover.....",3
"MehIt is a lovely setting in South Kensington and beautifully decorated. We came on a Saturday lunchtime and had brunch. The menu is appealing and reasonably priced considering the area. I had a bloody mary which at £9.50 was very disappointing. It was watery and had no kick despite asking for it to be spicy. The food itself was tasty, I had the avocado, poached eggs, feta and olives. My husband had the full english which he said was tasty but it arrived lukewarm with some of the items cold and the bacon undercooked with no colour on the fat. Would we come back again? Probably not given the many, many options available here. Its not terrible, but not good value for money.",3
Average food but nice eveningGood service and friendly staff however the food is average on the whole for dinner with nothing particularly outstanding!! Vegetarian options could be expanded but they offer everything in two portion sizes which is helpful.,3
"Nice place for folks staying at AmpersandI only had breakfast here, and only once in 10 days. I like the variety of places in the South Kensington neighborhood, and I like eating breakfast outside. But my breakfast was nice...yogurt with fruit/granola, and very nice banana bread. And it's an attractive setting in the basement with brick walls and arched entry ways...like an old wine cellar. I don't know if you'd seek out Apero if you're not staying at the Ampersand, but I'm sure it has its fans.",3
"A couple of dishes missed the markYou can have a very good meal here if you choose wisely. The four dishes we enjoyed were the monk fish cheeks (there's more meat in those cheeks than you'd think!), the duck breast, gnocchi and the croquettas. The two dishes that disappointed were the eggplant roll w/mozzarella which apparently came pre-made straight from the fridge so that it was so cold as to not have any flavor. The other disappointment was the sautéed sausage: one was rather bland and the other went in the opposite direction and was way too salty. Otherwise, the space is attractive and the service was good.",3
"Lovely hotel ordinary restaurantHad dinner here not impressed was more like a tapas bar friendly staff and good bar ,which is what I think this place is a bar with small range of food ,left hungary which is not a good sign",3
Expensive tapasTapas always seems to be pricey fro what you get. We ordered the veggie sharing menu. Definitely not good value for money. Food was good but not great. Service was quite slow even after we let them know that we were going to the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall and didn't want to be late. Wouldn't go back as I'm quite sure we could find better for less in London pretty damn easily..,3
"First time but not the last....Went to Apero for their ‘Nonna Brunch’ with friends visiting from Spain and South Africa and I can honestly say “We Will Be Back!” From the moment we walked through the door right to when we left, we were treated like “family” as opposed to just another group of diners! I visit Italy once’s a month and I might have just found my one piece of Italian paradise hidden away in South Ken! Food was spectacular, their Aperol Spiritz as good as any I’ve had in Italy or Sicily and the service - Top Notch! #WeWillBeBack #TuttoBuonissimo",5
"Food was outstanding quality - well in season produceOur whole experience from start too finish was well and truly outstanding. From checking in at the reception from exiting the hotel.

The quality and presentation of the food was presented at a very high standard - the chefs are food geniuses -

Worth every penny - we will definitely be returning
Thank you for an amazing experience and delicious food",5
"One of the best in Londonon a vication from Israel with my dad and sister, we had full couse menu and it was absolutly amazing the food was so good word can't describe, very good service and lower price then expected, defenetly will come back there next time im in London.",5
Lovely resturant and perfect place for romantic dinner !!!!The resturant is amazing ! The dinner was just lovely! The food is amazing and so delicious! Highly recommended! I must say the place is beautiful!!!,5
"OMG.... Words cannot describe.........My girlfriend and i had been told about this restaurant, so we decided to give it a go. We were a bit apprehensive due to have our 12 week old son with us, but we were made to feel so welcome, and the staff made a big fuss over our boy which was nice.

We started off with some amazing cocktails my girlfriend had a non-alcoholic cocktail which she loved.

All the food was absolutely amazing and words cannot describe how good it was, but two things i would suggest to anyone going would be the beef wellington and duck with red wine & cherries.

Even at the end the Chef Chris came and asked us if everything was ok and spoke with us about his food, one thing is for sure he is very passionate about his food and always looking for ways to improve.

~Overall 10/10 and will most certainly be returning soon.",5
"Absolutely Wow food!I came in to dine with one of my friends after suggestions from friends.
I can tell you the chef's selection from start to finishing was so tasty! My favourite dish would have to be the Scallops because od the presentation.. Wait and also the Octopus.. Am a big fan of seafood so the flavours of these dishes really delivered for me.
To this day am still wondering how the chef made smoked mash potatoes? Never thought of it myself it was devine!
Am coming back to try Afternoon Tea in a few weeks.. Maybe I can persuade the chef to sneak in a side of it!
I would definitely recommend this restaurant, such a lovely set up, friendly staff and especially for those who feel that they want their tastebuds exploded but new and exciting flavours!..",5
"Fantastic food and service to matchWent there after a day out in London. Considering the location of this restaurant I was pleasantly surprised at the prices especially after having the food. It’s was incredibly delicious and you could tell that the products were carefully sourced and of the highest quality. We complimented the chef and what a delightful and charming person he was as the rest of the staff. We felt very well looked after.

Have already told loads of friends to check this place out and shortly will be making another trip to fill my belly with delicious food. Highly recommend this place.",5
"Loved the food, drinks and atmosphereVisited couple of times this place, everytime we enjoy everything from the beginning till the end. The staff is great, helpful and attentive. We start some fresh bread, burata cheese, melon with parma ham and chicory and cherry salad. Everything was fresh, summery and refreshing. For a main course we had fish with mussels, octopus and lamb cooked in tomato. Absolutely loved everything. For a dessert - tiramisu and refreshing strawberry with crumbled biscuits and ice cream.

Definitely would recommend the place and will come back!",5
"Incredible!!Absolutely incredible food! Fresh, delicious, interesting, almost to pretty to eat. A stunning, relaxed restaurant offering fabulous food and cocktails, we will be returning again.",5
"Great Affordable DinnerApproved has a very unique menu with many interesting choices. The food was exceptional and the service very friendly. We walked out there after a full meal for four, two bottles of wine and cocktails and I was very reasonable. It was a great find. The one thing I would ding them was on their cocktails. Each had a huge piece of ice that all but eliminated the drink itself. It might be cool to look at but they sacrificed the drink itself. It was not a drink on ice but ice on some drink. But still it was a great meal with unique flavors and a great price. Wine list was ok.",5
"Could not have been made to feel more unwelcome, and NO Pancakes!I booked this venue for a brunch to start out anniversary celebrations. They have got wonderful reviews on the website a good menu and a new world renowned popcorn martini. However, my experience could not have been further fro their online reviews.

On arrival I was asked my room number (it appears the neighbouring Premier Inn uses it for breakfast) and that I couldn't eat unless I had one. I had to explain I had booked brunch.
I was told breakfast would be being stopped serving. So I asked if that affected brunch. I was old it would not.
We ordered a popcorn martini and Buttermilk pancakes.

About 5 minutes later they returned to say they had no syrup for the martini and could not do it, they hadn't had any for a few days now! (Amazon delivery?)
And they did not have any pancakes, which begged the question whether the pancakes were actually freshly made or just microwaved.

We walked out and went to Searcy's at St Pancras for an altogether more pleasurable and lighter experience. Bar+Block itself is dark dingy and could use a few lessons in both customer service and stock control when launching new food items!.

I will never give it another try",1
RidiculousWalked through the door to a basically empty restaurant at around 10:30 searching for breakfast. To be told that they only served to the hotel guests next door and that they were fully booked. Personally I feel the waitress took one look and us and couldn’t be bothered. Cheers.,1
"No reservationSo so rude. Just because I did not reserve a table, the manager was not interested. Standing on the side waiting without being serve in any form. Will not be returning.",1
"TerribleWithout a doubt, the most I have ever paid for the smallest, most over cooked steak ever! After being shown to my seat, at the bar, and being given a butter knife to eat a steak with, (this is a steak house right), I had to endure this “meal” which verged on inedible. Visit at your own peril! Staff were only interested in my payment, no one asked how my meal was or even paid me any attention at all. Wish I had just gone to Nando’s down the road.",1
Weatherspoons is betterWe just came back from Disney Paris and was staying in the premier Inn witch is great we came here as it was late and look nice and can access it straight from the hotel it was rammed tables stuck close together we both had a steak and a drink was the worst like of s.... I have ever ate chips were not cooked my so called 8oz sirloin steak was luke warm and fatty was the worst steak I have ever ate I have had a much better steak in a weatherspoons and that included a pint bill came to over 50 pound never again dont waste your time or money the only good thing was the beef flavour pop corn I'd rate 0 if I could,1
TerribleTerrible food here. My steak is was dry and well overdone. Sides were way below mediocre. My brother had the tomahawk steak and it was so small and crap he had to send it back. Luckily they took it off the bill cos the manager knew straight away. Do not recommend. You could do better in Wetherspoons for less than half the price!,1
"Steakhouse who cook the meat only Well Done?? Really!?went to this steakhouse with couple of friends on friday around 18h00

Spacious place well located near Kingcross St Pancras

I wanted to try their Mighty Block Burger and asked it medium rare.... unfortunately the waitress has told me they can cook only well done :(

What??? Hold on its says Steakhouse isnt it? Thought steakouse supposed to offer at least medium cook meat... Nope not this place... Well not for their Mighty Block Burger....

My friend ordered it as she wanted to try and whats happen when you have your meat cooked well done?? You ended up eating a rubber shoe!!

Anyway i ended up ordering a half chicken which has nothing special
Sauce was so so....salade served in the side was not great.... Chips.....are chips well....

Before leaving the place i went to the loo and its...... DIGUISTING!
one of the loo was blocked s***t was floating around eurk!!!! bon appetit!!!

Told the waitress to check theit toilet really as this was really awful!

Won't go back there and definitely not recommended for the steak lovers......",1
Awful experience and will never returnWent here for a friends birthday and had to preorder everything ! I originally ordered steak and eggs and the steak was like rubber and the eggs came out cold ! Everyone else's meal was also cold and the service was shocking! I still had to pay for my meal even though I could have made it better myself! The food was disgusting and cold and I won't be returning! It is embarrassing for this place!,1
"Worst ""Premier Inn"" breakfast ever!Dear es126,

I would like to apologise for your steak and eggs and the fact they were not hot enough when served as we do pride ourselves on the quality of food we would not want any guests experience to be effected by the temperature of their meal.

Your feedback has been shared with our Kitchen Manager, so that the cooking standards are reviewed and further training implemented where necessary. If you wish please contact me by email on barandblock.kingscross@whitbread.com to discuss this further.


Kind Regards,

Alice Tait-Harris

"DisappointingWith all the 5 star reviews I had high expectations. I do not believe the high rating is deserved.
The service was very slow.
Other diner’s meals were brought to our table.
We ordered 2 different gins and tonics. However, when the order arrived the waiter did not know which was which.
Two of our three steak orders were not cooked anything like what was requested. I will not return.",2
"Disappointing breakfastMy husband and I stopped in for breakfast, we ordered ala carte as the buffet breakfast had finished. My poached eggs were cooked well, and the avocado mash was ok, the bacon was alright.... my partner had scrambled eggs that we assume were left over from the buffet bain Marie as they were soo cardboard-y and had a hard skin on them... the toast was just try toast. All in all it was cheep and warm (took a few tries to get the orders right). I would say go to the buffet breakfast, which seemed a reasonable cost (like a hotel puts on) and at least get all you can eat variety. Since found much better places to eat in the area.",2
Bar & block king crossI was staying at premier Inn in Kings cross London. I was treated like poorly as I was still in my work gear. Nearly every thing is extra. I ordered the block bugger it was so dry I could Bearley get it on my fork and all it tasted of was salt it was over powering and also cold. I told the waiter and he didn't care. £250 a night I expect better,2
"Chef's, -stop fingering our food !I've been here a LOT. Mainly because its handy, you can see your food being cooked.
Also someone in our family died due to contaminated meat in the UK (true) so we continually check hygiene ratings.

We were there 23/03/18, 8pm, when it was brought to my attention that every steak was being tested for what looked like a primitive heat test, using a bare finger. Often several times on the same steak/dish. It was obviously a common practice.

Fortunately, we were eating the vegetarian option (as usual).

I tried to play down the issue at the time as not to spoil the evening, or future visits. But obviously loosing a family member to contaminated Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) ....WE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HYGIENE and I have waited after the anger has passed over before we have submitted our review.

We also saw a friend of one of the chef's go over to shake his hand. The chef continued to touch/finger the steaks without washing.

Only the meat was fingered as far as we could determine.

In no way have I/we lied, and our observations are 100% as we all saw the cooked meat handled in this way. .

I have kept the receipts, and await your reply.",2
"Beware the black and fiery sauce - it’s just worcester sauce and will ruin your steak!This place looks deceptively modern. The decor is good, the staff are friendly and efficient. Looks nice.

However the meal was highly unsatisfactory. salt and pepper squid was bland but not terrible.

The steak was cooked nicely but the chips were a bit hard, the salad was very basic and their ‘black and fiery sauce’ was horrible! Basically worcestershire sauce diluted a little.
I can still taste it now the next morning and i feel slightly sick. I’ve no problem with worcester sauce in small quantities but not in half cupfulls.

A good steak sauce should be oleaginous and rich, not watery and overpowering. A dreadful thing to do to a good piece of meat and quite an insult at £1.50. i could buy a whole bottle of Lea and Perrins for that and ruin dozens of steaks if i wanted.

Basically this place looks modern but it’s really just a warmed over Berni inn. Don’t get fooled!",2
"TanitaWe came here because of the positive reviews and proximity to our hotel.
Sadly the experience was disappointing.
The service was extremely slow. Our beers came 10 minutes after our main course!!!
The side dish came as a dessert...
The food was OK. The kids menu is good, the steak was over cooked but still tasty.
They were out of their new desert.",2
"Poor breakfastWe are staying in the area and has dinner there. Food was amazing.

Went for ‘brunch’ - decided not to go for the mass produced bargain all you can eat and ordered from the menu. Sadly it was the same crap they bought to us - tho the toast looked different.

Huge disappointment. Will go for dinner it not for anything else.",2
"Disappointed with Tomahawk SteakOrdered a Tomahawk Steak for 2. Was disappointed with it. It came back dry and not juicy. Was recommended to have it in MEDIUM and NOT MEDIUM RARE. Should have had it in Medium rare instead.

It was also strange that the meat was cut and sliced before being grilled..RATHER than having the whole Tomahawk Meat Steak Grilled first and allowed to be carved or sliced by the customers.

Maybe the learned reader of this website can contribute to this review by giving us all their opinion on this matter above.",2
"Very poor value for moneyWe had a meal here on Tuesday evening. When we went in we were told it was full but could see a dozen tables not being used, but wait, ah! there is one available. Luck us.
We had the Butchers Block special - Brisket (circa £19) and the 'ribs 'n chicken'. There was a medium pile of thinly sliced brisket and tub of chunky chips. The brisket was OK at best, but fairly tasteless and I'd struggle to value this at anything more than £10. The ribs were nice but the chicken was dry to that point where chicken is hard to swallow. But as I was still hungry after the brisket and we hadn't ordered sides I had to eat that too.
Clearly I should have tried a steak.....",2
"Disappointing visit.Visited her with my sister on a Saturday evening for a late dinner. We where greeted and seated by a very friendly young lady didn't catch her name as she spoke very quickly. We scanned through the menu, we where hungry having not eaten since breakfast. We where given a bottle of water and some popcorn which was a nice touch. We both chose the Mexican chicken burger which was described on the menu as ""Spicy chicken BREAST with guacamole, sour cream, tomato, lettuce and red onion. The burger arrived very quickly accompanied by thin fries the chicken Breast was actually a chicken SLICE having been fried on a griddle. We both ate the meagre offering and brought the portion size to the waitress when presented with a bill for £23.00 as we where both still hungry. The waitress said we where basically to late to complain and should of brought it to her attention before eating. I then asked to talk to a manager who reluctantly gave us 50% off after some deliberation. We left hungry and disappointed as this was rated as a good place to eat.
I will quite happily pay the full amount for a meal than pay half price and leave hungry and disappointed. Menu needs updating bit of false advertising in the description of the food item",2
"Nice quick biteIf you want a decent steak and dont mind a busy and quite noisy atmosphere, this place will fit the bill. If your looking for something more intimate, keep looking. My steak was good but I thought the thimble of sauce was a bit mean.",3
"OK, but not wonderfulWe used this restaurant, situated within the Premier Inn in which we were staying partly for convenience and partly because the menu appealed.

Serving staff were very friendly but clearly overworked and working full-pelt trying to take orders and service. I actually felt rathe. sorry for them based upon the circumstances in which they were being asked to operate.

The premises were particularly noisy (which we neither wanted not needed) and the noise from a crowded bar area (it was Friday evening) easily permeated into the adjacent, open plan, restaurant. We had to move tables to a point further from the bar, only to find that a table adjacent to our new one was then allocated to a couple who were shouting at each other in order to heard over the din, so we had to be moved again.

The food was acceptable, but the 'medium' steak part of the mixed grill was cooked rather more than this, and the mixed grill contents a bit limited (though I knew this from the menu).

This is not a place for a quiet dinner.

Breakfast the next morning was acceptable rather than exceptional but in fairness it was not overly expensive for London.

I shall not trouble this restaurant with my custom again.",3
"Express steak!We were a group of 6 and ordered from the express lunch menu. We felt the food was good value but wasn’t quite “express” - as advertised on the menu. We waited around 45 minutes and the restaurant was very quiet at the time of our visit! I cannot fault the customer service as it was friendly and polite, and I really liked the restaurant ambience. With the central location and the value of the food, I’d visit again :-)",3
"Not great for the priceWe visited at a very low-paced time (around 4pm on a Friday) and had an OK experience. There were 4 of us. 2 ordered the special, medium rare. 2 ordered off the menu.
One special came out a beautiful medium rare. Another came out medium-well. It was sent back and a new steak came out, rare. For a steak place to not accomplish a nice medium rare is one thing, but knowing that one of us got a well cooked steak, and they couldn't do it for another seemed a bit odd... almost like they were trying to undercook the second one to prove a point. The manager comped the poorly cooked steak, but we all felt a bit embarrassed to be a part of the experience.
Also, the waiter recommended to my husband to get a rib eye over the special because the rib eye would be less fatty, and then it ended up being the fattiest piece of steak at the table.",3
"BreakfastDropped into Bar and Block in Kings Cross for a quick breakfast before seeing a relative off. The complimentary popcorn before our breakfast was a lovely surprise.
We had the Bar & Block Works breakfast with a rump steak for an extra £2. It was lovely but the steaks were on the tough side.
The service was attentive.",3
Tasty and fastI really enjoyed the evening with the very good steak and wine. Quick service. Nice interior with simple design.,3
"Somewhere between average and very goodIf I could, I would give Bar + Block 3.5 out of 5. Somewhere between average and very good.

The system for booking a table was very easy. The welcome was very friendly and efficient. The decor is smart and appealing.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive but he did get a part of the order wrong. There was some confusion over whether chips or fries had been ordered. It wasn't a huge deal but it did mean that my friend had a longer wait for his original order to arrive. My friend's steak was also not cooked as requested, and came out bloodier than he liked. We swapped dishes rather than waste further time.

In terms of the food, my friend is a huge fan of Bar + Block and loved his Burnt Ends (which were very tasty) and the 10oz spiral cut fillet steak. I had the salt and pepper squid which was ok. The texture was fine but it was bland and not really worth ordering. I also had the spiral cut steak and while it was very tender, it was underwhelming for me.",3
Hotel breakfastGood ambience. Breakfast spread was so so .... Coffee from Costa was a delightful surprise. We hope to come for drinks/dinner on some nights while we are still here.,3
"Friendly staff, standard foodI went to this place as I saw it highly rated on the guide. This being my 8th steakhouse in London, personally I would say it is good, but not like to be that close to the top. Regarding the staff, they are very friendly and I really had the “welcome” feeling. Pricing, really good, as it was just $32 (including tip) for a starter, a beer, a cut and an extra side.
Now the food. Starter (mac and cheese bites) was really good, as well as the extra side I requested (wild mushrooms). For the included side I requested the salad. It was cold, like if they just pulled from the fridge and gave it to me. As usual, I requested a rib-eye medium (to be fair on the comparison). I have to say you can notice this is non aged, non premium cut. It was tough and a little overcooked, more like medium well. Although that, its flavor was really good and just a touch of salt was required.",3
"Nice decorThe restaurant is beautifully decorated. However, we spent about 5mins waiting at an empty host area waiting to be seated. The waiter we eventually had was pleasant. I would not recommend the flattened chicken salad. It would be nice if they did smaller sized steaks too. Smallest they do is 8 oz.",3
"Great steak!not so many bars understand ""medium-rare"" in a European definition. I'm pleased to say bar+block steakhouse understand this. I enjoyed my rib steak with sweet potato & serving was quick too. I can recommend this bar.",4
Great find so close to Kings Cross stationLooking on Tripadvisor for somewhere to eat in the Kings Cross area we decided to try this place. On arrival we were shown to a table quickly and the drinks order taken almost immediately. When the drinks arrived we were ready to order our food. My wife had a rib eye steak which was cooked exactly as she asked and i had a classic beefburger substituting the bun for a salad which was also very good quality. Reasonably priced food for London. Worthy of a second visit.,4
"Good food, slow service.We attended as a group of four, waited around 10 minutes 'after' we ordered drinks to even arrive .......

The food came out, tasted great which was the saving grace for this place - so not sure what happened when we ordered drinks initially.

Would return, if I was in the area - but wouldn't go out of my way.",4
"Really good place for steak in LondonWe were surprised to find such quality meat in London for such a good price. The meat, in our case the ribeye and fillet, was cooked to perfection. The starters we had were really good as well. The service was great. The only downside were the slightly bland chunky fries and the overcooked dough of the churros. We would definitely recommend the place.",4
"Friends birthdaySo I booked a table for 8 for my friends birthday.
It is a lovely venue but the service was slow. My steak was a bit grisly but otherwise well cooked even though they gave me my friends steak instead. I will go back and try their massive burger though!",4
"Steak with lovely sidesWe had to wait for a table, a half hour wait at 8:45pm but since we had just arrived in London and we wanted to eat we waited. We got shown to our seats on time and both had the steak. Steak was good but we have both had better but the sides were really good. I had sweet potato fries and my partner had the chips with mac n cheese bites and all were amazing. One tip save room for dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding and the churros and oh my goodness so good. Would recommend to eat here if in the area as we thought it was quite good value for money for London.",4
"Family MealVisited early Saturday evening as a table of four, quickly seated with menus - drinks order taken and soon arrived. Ordered two fish and chips and two burger meals, both the Indian Chicken tikka burgers.
The food soon arrived and was tasty - not the hottest. Had to try and get the waitresses eye to arrange a further round of drinks, no one check if everything was ok.
Due to time, we declined a sweet, our choice not due to any delays.
Service friendly, not over the top, the food was good, would return if in the area though might try other restaurants as well",4
"Happy HourHappy Hour 4-7pm which was great!
Free popcorn when you sat down. Waiter was okay.
They had run out of mac and cheese bites which was a shame but the gnocchi was nice (needed a dip).
Chicken burger was good, just the chicken wasn't very big out of the bun.
Steaks were really good. One had to be sent back as it was overcooked.
Churros Sundae was very good too.",4
"Great breakfastWe were short of time and looking for breakfast. Stumbled across this and we were very impressed.
Steak for breakfast sounds unreal but two eggs ,some great potatoes and steak strips cooked to my liking were superb.
Wife had granola and it was not just a picture to look at but she said it was even better than it looked.
Well done ,
Staff were also friendly which is a big bonus.",4
"A Rough Start to a Good EndingIf first impressions would be all that mattered, this restaurant would receive much less than 4 stars. When I walked through the door and sat down at the bar, the bartender rudely greeted me with ""Yes?"". When I indicated that I would like some food, they pointed me toward the hostess in the middle of the restaurant. This person was clearly stressed and, thus his greeting was polite but strained; he made every effort to convey that he wanted my business and asked that I wait a very brief time. Given that I had already walked a long while to find this place, I consented. From the moment he was able to find a table for me, my experience was nothing but positive. The steak was cooked to perfection and the house salad was delicious. My server was attentive to my needs throughout the meal and promptly returned with the items I ordered.

It's very difficult being a solo diner in London - not every place is happy to see your face and some are more direct about their displeasure than others. I'm glad I persevered through the initial disappointment at this restaurant and was rewarded with a delicious meal.",4
"GREAT RESTAURANT ... GREAT SERVICEJust returned from a 5 day break at adjoining premier inn, booked the meal deal for breakfast & evening meal.......both the service and meals were excellent. Would like to thank bar & block staff for an enjoyable time.",5
Nice dinnersI really enjoyed my meal. Chef wade cooked ours steaks to perfections. Our waiter Vlad was fabulous and very professional. I will definitely come back. Many thanks guys!,5
Great restaurantWe just arrived from Pqris and wanted to have dinner. The restaurant is greatly situated next to Kings Cross and the food was delicious!,5
Very best of service from Elisa LWell first of all I work for a restaurant I know what your supposed to do and ask as part of that job well me my wife and my girls where in and very luckily looked after by Elisa L we are from the north east and had a lovely but very long day exploring londan wired one min to be seated with in minutes Elisa came over and looked after us from water to my kids haha she was great went beyond what she had to do to keep us happy any thing we needed she was genuinely happy to help it was a pleasure being looked after by her will be back she needs a well done all round as the lady was waiting a lot of tables and still had time for every one from Chris and my family loved the service from start to finish,5
Great meal. Good atmosphere.Right next to St pancreas. Great meal. Beautifully cooked steak. Full off people having great night. Staff very attentive and friendly especially Eliza.,5
"SublimeCame down to London for the day on business and stumbled across this place whilst searching for a bite too eat. I started with the salt and pepper squid which was beautiful and served perfectly. I then went for the 10oz ribeye medium rare which again was cooked to perfection with sweet potatoes fries, which came with feta and small slices of pepperoni on them alongside some mac and cheese balls.

A lovely atmosphere, very professional staff and beautiful and well present food. 10/10 would recommend.",5
"An excellent findTravelling on Eurostar we have stopped over and have used this restaurant twice recently. We consider this an excellent find. The restaurant had a good atmosphere and offered a good varied menu. Staff were polite and attentive. There had been a nine day gap between our visits and when we arrived for the second time the Manager greeted us saying he remembered us and referred to a previous conversation. He apologized for not saving our same table, but had set one aside for us knowing we had preferred to sit in a particular area. We will definitely use this restaurant again.",5
"Such a nice place to eat, that the Bar and Block will be our first port of call when arriving at King Cross.Travelled down to Kings Cross by train and arrived in London at lunch time Thursday 26th July 2018, during the blistering heat.

Having walked around the various bars and restaurants near Kings Cross looking for a suitably impressive, clean and cool place for a casual business meeting, it was through luck that we found this Restaurant and we are so pleased that we did.

Really nicely furnished with a lovely open feel due to the generous spacing between tables and chairs.

The staff were wonderful and a real credit to the Management.

The drinks prices were on the lower side of average and they had a really good selection.

The food that we ordered was the Chicken Club Sandwich, which was very nice indeed and much lower price than the opulent surroundings would lead you too believe it would be.

Supidly we left a brand new jacket hanging on the chair, however, when contacting them through the website by email, the manager called by telephone for our address and the next thing we knew it was winging its way back to our home.

In this day and age, it is very rare to get such good customer service.

We would encourage anyone reading this to try the Bar + Block.

Paul and Rach",5
Food coma!The food was incredible. The steak was perfect and they had lot’s of great sides to choose from. The staff was really friendly and fun. We had churros for dessert and I think it may have been the best dessert I’ve had. Absolutely recommend this restaurant and we will be back the next time we go to London!,5
"David’s Service was incredible!We went for a few spontaneous few drinks in Kings Cross and found Bar + Block Steakhouse on Google Maps, after a few very good value drinks we decided to get some food and was greeted by David who was from the start incredible with handling us and seating us. We sat directly in front of the open kitchen (a fantastic buzz in the kitchen to see). David’s timings were exemplary, his recommendations on food & drinks were outstanding, (recommending wine to a French girl can be difficult but he delivered well!) and we took the specials he recommended. To top it all off the food was great so well done to the chefs and kitchen staff.
Seriously great visit, thank you very much Gino for running a great shift whilst we were visiting.
David, keep up the great work and you will get whatever it is you’re working towards!
(Receipt numbers 5015 David E, Chk 9253, House no. 2177681)",5
"Terrible service experienceThe food was fine, the atmosphere was OK and the service experience we had was one of the worst ever. Our waiter's shift got over and he just left without anyone picking up our table. We waited around about 45 minutes with no one coming by the table before we figured out what had happened. The incompetent manager didn't make sure that we were taken care of when he let our waiter leave. When I complained to the manager about what had happened he gave me a very insincere apology - he could have cared less! Avoid this place at all costs!",1
"Unacceptable level of serviceI’m going to be very straight forward. I was chocked at the level of carelessness of this establishment’s staff members (waiters to be exact). I’ve had lunch here today and I couldn’t help it but to notice servers walking around drinking and eating in front of restaurant guests without any sort of concern!! After finishing my main course, I’ve decided to try a dessert. I asked my waitress for a crêpe and to my surprise, she brought it to me after 20 seconds...I realized it was not made to order but didn’t care so I tried it and let me tell you...it was literally a piece of hard rubber. So I kindly asked for another one...the waitress apologized and said it’ll be right out. 20 minutes later still no crepe and my waitress changed her clothes and left the restaurant...I was in chock!! I’ve addressed the issue to management, the kindly apologized but it was too late at that point. Unacceptable unacceptable!!!",1
"Avoid Cote in Sloane Square. Go to Dorking instead.On Saturday December 9th I and 3 guests had a pre-theatre dinner at Cote. Having had excellent food and service from Cote in Dorking we were appalled at what we received at Cote Sloane Square.1) On arrival we discovered our reserved table had been given to another customer. 2) We arrived at 17.55. We did not get our starters until 18.45. Almost an hour. 3) Starters, including soup were cold on arrival and had to be sent back 4) With theatre booked for 19.30 we had o rush our main course and had no time for dessert. 5) No apology was made by the staff nor adjustment to the bill for the bas service. Cote in Dorking always makes suitable (and much appreciated) gestures whenever even minor problems arise e.g. not charging for the wine. We asked to see the Manager who was most disagreeable and quite rude.He was not apologetic and would not listen. We told him in no uncertain terms that this was not the way to treat customers. He then shouted at us that he was not going to charge us for the meal and that we should get out of his restaurant. There was a total lack of grace and good manners. We knew the restaurant was busy and that it was a peak time. But in such conditions the Manager should be conciliatory and apologetic to customers, and not act like a prima donna. He should learn from the way Cote is managed in Dorking that offers first class food and service. He is letting down the good name of Cote.",1
"25 minute wait between course, has gone downhillThis Cote can't get it together. We ordered salads, then mains. A short wait for salads, which were okay, then 25 minutes later, when we started asking we got the lies... the kitchen screwed up, I forgot to order your mains (this from a waiter who hadn't taken our order, a woman had). We said we'd leave, then,in 30 seconds ""nuked"" crepes which were mush arrived. Mediocre. Cote used to be pleasant, reasonable and tasty. What has happened. AVOID this one. It rivals the Barbican one for mediocre food.",1
"Bad experienceWent with my sister for an early dinner,had no booking so we were told that we can have a table for 1hour 15 minutes only as they are fully booked! We ordered the fried cod with French fries, the order was promptly on the table, we were busy talking but I realised the fish was chewy so it wasn't properly cooked,I told one of the waiters about it,he said he'll let the chef know, came back & asked if my sister had the same problem, she was washing her hands I said I don't know, he then told me that the chef said that he put them together, I have a sensitive stomach so told him if I happen to suffer food poisoning will let them know, his answer was; I'll give you our business card in case you want to call, my sister & I suffered from upset stomach for the next couple of days!! Just to say the least that we are used to have well cooked food and know exactly how the food should taste. Not to mention the answer I had from the staff. Will avoid this restaurant for sure.",1
"Very poor, disgusting food.My mother and I had lunch in Cote yesterday and it was terrible! We had booked a table for 12.30 so that it wouldn't be too busy as we have waited an hour for lunch there in the past. My mother ordered the spinach and mushroom crepes, which, when it finally arrived, was disgusting. It was just tasteless pancakes swimming around in watery milk with the odd floating spinach leaf - not the nice cheese sauce you would imagine! The manager came over to apologise and took it away and said the chef would sort it out in the kitchen. About 15 mins later she came back to say the chef was unable to sort it out (as we had suspected!) and asked if she wanted something else instead ""on the house"". By this time we had been there for 50 minutes and Mum still hadn't had anything to eat and my chicken and chips was getting colder and colder as I tried to eke it out waiting for them to bring something else for her. Eventually they brought out cold eggs benedict, with the cheapest looking rectangle of reformed ham I have ever seen! Not surprisingly my mother struggled to eat that too. When the bill arrived we were also charged for the eggs benedict which we had been told was ""on the house"". Come on Cote - you need to up your game. It used to be a reliably good place to go, but my last two visits there have been decidedly disappointing.",1
"Horrible discriminatory service!!Disgusting service!!

Couple of my friends and I decided to have breakfast there one morning.
Asked the waitress if they had a vegan menu. She said ""no"" and then went on to say ""I know it's the latest fashion to be vegan"".. (no joke, she actually said it!!!)
You can imagine my reaction. I was furious and I made it known I was. I definitely complained to the manager.

After my friends had their breakfast we asked for the bill. And the bloody cheek, they put service charge on it! (Needless to say I didn't pay it!)

Not going back to a place where there is discrimination!!!!",1
"They've Lost The PlotI have been enjoying this restaurant for 6 years now when I am in Town. My visit this week was terrible. I ordered Vodka Tonic/No lemon 5 times before the server got it right. The Breton Chicken, always a favourite was terrible and the potatoes overcooked and dry. Still expensive but now the value is gone-and so am I",1
"AwfulAfter a lovely concert at Cadogan Hall we went for a late dinner here.
We didn't want anything too big as it was late.
My sister ordered the Calamari & I had the Crepes.
We should have guessed the staff were not up to much when a male waiter came and whispered something into the ear of our female waitress while she was taking our order! Very unprofessional I thought. When the Calamari arrived, they were served in a RUSTY iron skillet. When we complained, the Supervisor told us they were usually served in this skillet with paper. If this was the case, why did the waiter not notice ??? I worked in a greasy spoon Cafe many years ago (family run) and if I noticed something wrong on a plate - I would never serve it to the customer !!!
Re-training all round would be my suggestion to the ""Management""",1
"AwfulIt was all great, food, service etc until 11pm when the restaurant was starting to empty. I couldn't believe it, they turned the lights up bright and put the air con on!!!
I asked them to turn them down again and one waiter said he would but it didn't happen. I asked another waiter, who also said they would but didn't.
Fair enough if it was 1 am but this was 11pm in central London!!!!
Just awful",1
"Close encounter of the worst kindCould this be the only disappointing Cote in London? We have up to now found Cote reliable, with good food and service, no matter which branch you visit, but this one let the side down big time.

It didn’t start well. I arrived quite early for a pre-concert dinner with friends. I stood while the host carried on texting. He wasn’t looking up at all. He wasn’t bothered about customers, just chortling at his phone. He finished, sighed when I gave my name, made no apology and led me through to the main part of the restaurant.

We then got Mr Patronising Waiter. On being asked for a large bottle of sparkling wearer, he felt that we needed a full and very condescending explanation of the difference between Badoit and Perrier. Well thank you, but we were drinking Perrier before he was born. He decided (wrongly) which two should be given wine. Why should he ask? He knew everything.

Time passed. The restaurant began to fill up dramatically and the kitchen was clearly struggling.

Only when Mr P came to take the order did he remember that 3 of the dishes, all of which were on both the fixed and a la carte menu, were not available. So we had to think again. More people arrived and by now space had become so tight that neither waiters nor customers could pass between the tables without knocking something or someone.

Aha! The chap whose job it was to carry a massively loaded tray at shoulder height (in order to try and avoid dropping dishes down a customer’s neck) was valiantly steering his way from the tiniest kitchen hatch ever with our order. Poor guy. Mr Patronising decided to try and serve one dish at a time to us while still holding on to a smaller silver tray loaded with dirty cutlery, receipts and a card machine. Which would drop first? Only consummate juggling by the junior of his big tray saved the fish pie.

Bang went our friend’s chair as another person cannoned into it. She had just managed to take in a forkful of risotto and almost spat it out again. It was so mushy and watery. We told Mr P who just shrugged and went to deal with someone much more important. The tomato salad was good but the green salad distinctly old and unhappy.

The smiley bearded chap who arrived with dessert menus was much better. He at least tried to make us feel welcome. But the special lemon crème brûlée had hardly any taste at all with just five thin strands of lemon zest lurking at the bottom. Mr P returned to throw sugar across the table at us for coffee.

The bill included a 12.5 per cent service charge. We asked for this to be removed in lieu of the terrible risotto but it took 2 attempts before the right amount could be taken off our card. And still more people poured in, with nowhere to put them and everyone having to turn sideways to even try to move.

As a final annoyance, those who need access to the disabled toilet are faced by stairs or a sign asking them to find one of the waiting team. In the circumstances, we decided to hang on for the concert hall.

This Cote is attached to a hotel so maybe it’s some sort of franchise. If so, a manager needs to get a grip. We’ve never had such an experience at any other Cote.",2
"Dried out & overcookefPlatt du jour boeuf bourginone was overcookef and dried out , and so too cod. Perfunctory service. The room is rather gloomy so all in all a disappointing ev3ning.",2
"Why serve reheated foodUsually good but tonight pre cooked and then reheated food was served in two separate courses. Why does the chef try to get away with this . I suppose he thinks that the customer dies not notice , well we did!!.
A pisaladiere was dried out and hard and the cod goujon were also hard on the outside and grey inside. So so disappointing.
Obviously poor kitchen control.
The cost was removed from the bill but the evening ruined. NOT GOOD ENOUGH.",2
"Not treated with respectI've been to a few Cote Brasseries, but here I was made to feel disrespected. Don't seat ""little old ladies"" dining alone at the worst table in the house right next to the kitchen entrance when there are plenty of other tables available. When I moved my table slightly I was pounced upon by a member of staff who peremptorily moved it the few inches back whilst telling me off. Had I not been both tired and very hungry I would have left the restaurant at that point even though I had placed my order. It is not an atmosphere I wish to return to.",2
"DisappointingAs a few friends, we when to this restaurants and ordered from the Pre-Theatre Menu. The menu seemed nice, however, the food was not as good as I had at other Cote Brasseries, the best of the food there was the chips. I don’t if it was due to the size of the restaurant as it is very large and extremely busy. The staff kept pushing into us as they rushed through the restaurant and at one stage spilled over some leftover liquid from the food but failed to clean up until we asked, then the staff member proceeded to mop it up with one of the serviettes. I won’t be rushing back.",2
"Too noisy...Ir is really a pity, normally I would give at least 3 to 4 stars to this place, but unfortunately I tried it 4 or 5 times at lunch and dinner and I experienced each time the same issue: the noise is so loud that you won't be able to talk to the orhers at tour table.",2
"Reception staff extremely rudeon arrival for a family lunch which had been pre-booked we were challenged by the reception staff who were very rude and dismissive. We eventually got our table, the food & serving staff were better than the reception we received on arrival. When we got home we found that our reservation that had been booked some days beforehand had been cancelled less than an hour before our booked time.
They certainly pack people in with the tables very close together.",2
"Ok food, but way too loud!We went here for a lunch, but regretted doing shortly after being shown to our table. Not because of the service or the food, but because it was way too loud. The risotto was good, but the chicken salad was less than average: too much dressing and just three pieces of avocado. Would not go back.",2

"Poor quality for the priceIt’s not that expensive for central London but the food is not exciting at all. We had haddock with undercooked potatoes and leeks, duck with sauce that seemed to come from a packet, and lamb that needed a v sharp knife. It was alright, but for the money best to find somewhere more exciting.",2
"English BreakfastFrench style. Early arrival at Sloane Square Hotel and this restaurant is attached to it. So, to kill time, we ate breakfast here.

The food was ok. I had the Croque Monsieur Classic ham and Gruyère cheese sandwich. It did the trick. But I'm starting to think that Brasserie in London means very slow service. The Bloody Mary I ordered was not that good.

They have tables out in front which might be nice for cup of coffee or (maybe) a glass of wine but as a destination restaurant, I'd pass.",3
"Rather average, quick meal efficiently delivered in pleasant settingWe went in here to kill time and fill a hole in our stomachs before a show. It was typical ""kit food"". I can just imagine the ""chef""s putting the food together according to the instructions on the packet. The waitress asked how the food was and being in a honest mood, I said, ""It's good but not great"" - she called the manager. He asked if I had a complaint. I explained I had simply answered honestly, the food being average, just what I expected. The place was heaving so I think there is a demand for this kind of stuff, so I do not want to put you off.",3
"Why the rush?An almost deserted restaurant on a hot mid week day we had a table a few back from the open windows and the ones by the windows were reserved.

Had a garlic bread (can’t spell the proper name) followed by the minute steak n frites. Food was fine but I was literally still eating the bread when the mains arrived. Given it was virtually empty what was the rush?",3
Watch the billI don't like staff adding service 'by mistake'when you've Already tipped them!!the food is ok I've been several times with friends and it's easy to find/meet at BUT I have this issue with 12.5 percent added it does not reward GOOD service,3
"Good - between Average and Very GoodWe use Cote a lot as a reliable place to eat when out and about. This was an early pre theatre stop. The staff were good and the food was good, although not anything particularly memorable. The reason I've marked down this time was the whole experience felt extremely rushed with the starters coming out so very quickly and the mains hot on their heels. We didn't want to linger particularly but it did feel they wanted us in and gone quick sharp, despite having free tables and it being in the lull period before after work/pre theatre really gets going.",3
Could have been betterI took my mum here for a brunch and wasn't overly impressed with the slow service. The food was fine and coffee was nice but I was dissapointed with the service as they were very slow to serve us and I had to request they came over twice. We waited a good 10 minutes to have our order taken (that's a long time if the venue is less than a quarter full) and then were served food without drinks which I had to chase and wait an additional 10 minutes. Just not impressed and wouldn't go again to be honest. Much prefer the service in the branch behind Oxford Street and Blackheath...,3
Simple onion soup stopWe were looking for a stop after walking from the Palace to Saatchi...we stopped at Cote for snacks...we ended up with French onion soup...warm on a cold day...it was OK...what was fun was our seatmate was an author...I have since started reading his book...,3
"Slightly below par for Cote4 of us visited for supper at 8pm on 20th Feb. Cote are a really good chain: consistently good food and wine, good value and good service. However, after 3 visits to this one, I have to say it is below par: it’s noticeably more noisy than other Cotes, and the service is adrift - our waiter on this occasion was very slow and very complacent and inattentive, and the service on the other times has also been below the standard at other Cotes. I hope it can be improved here.",3
"usual godd value but the service!!!Cote doesn't disappoint with food or value for money. However recently went on my second visit to branch in Sloane Square and the service was as dismal as first visit. It's a year since my last visit and the same waters (broadest sense of the term) were still there in body but not in mind. Even though the restaurant was barely half full and there seemed to be waiting staff every where you looked they are unbelievably incompetent. Had to ask two or three times for the same orders, had to almost stand on the tables and shout to get any service between courses. They took half an hour to bring the bill after we had asked for it, then two different people brought the bill twice. Truly unbelievably bad service.",3
"Excellent, alwaysI’m a big fan of Côte Brasseries. I’ve visited 4 or 5 of them and I’m a regular at their Parsons Green outlet do I was happy that the Sloane Square Brasserie keeps up the good standards they have elsewhere. Kudos to the head chef at Côte Brasseries.
Pity the maitre d’ passed an unnecessary comment when we arrived 25 minutes late but the good quality made up for his amateurishness. I would have given 4 stars otherwise.",3
"Watching the world go by . . .I like Cote; very consistent, decent french-style menu and good service at most of their brasseries. But Cote at Sloan Square has the additional benefit of outside tables where you can watch the 'Sloan' world go by. It's close-by rival on the square 'The Colbert' has recently restricted its lunch menu and increased its prices, so is not the good value it once was, so Cote is a much better choice now. The only trouble is on a warm, sunny day you get so chilled you keep having to order more to drink, so the bill usually ends up 70% drinks! C'est la vie!",4
"Nice lunchWent with female friend. Nice choice of fixed price 2 or 3 course lunches available. Good ,friendly and fast service. Food lovely, nice medium rare steak frites and very moreish pudding.
My friend had an equally nice fish and also a dessert.
Good French brasserie food at reasonable prices",4
"Relaxing mealWe enjoyed our meal at Côte today. The food was tasty & our waitress, Boroka, was helpful & ensured we had prompt service, so that we made it to the concert that we were going to afterwards, on time - without us feeling rushed. Thanks.",4
Good foodWe came here for lunch. It was extremely busy but because it is so big were able to get a table. The service was a bit slow initially but once we had ordered the food came quickly. The staff were friendly. As always the food was very good. We had the lunch menu which is very reasonable.,4
"a chain of successesThe Sloane Square branch followed the reliable standard set by Cote restaurants. Pleasant decor, good food and very good value. Set menu two courses well under Lstg 15, wine starting under Lstg 19 per bottle - both consumed with pleasure. Three courses a little bit more - but not much. The sound of happy diners not obtrusive music. Tables (available inside and out) not too close together. Service good. Forget parking - not somewhere one would drive to - didn't check the loos. Will continue to dine at Cote.....",4
"Fathers day treatHaving been to a Cote restaurant before in St Paul's area, and thoroughly enjoyed it, the family opted to try one again in a different location.

As we were going to a show that evening we booked to avoid disappointment and we were very pleased that we did. On arrival the restaurant was completely full apart from our table.

Our waitress for the evening was outstanding and she didn't miss a beat. Having brought our starters she was asked for some bread. Seeing how busy she and the restaurant was we didn't expect it to be brought so quickly, and with exceptional politeness. One family member has a seafood dish for main and she brought a dish for the shells without request. Common sense would say that that that was a given, however, we've had to request things such as this at more expensive restaurants.

The brilliant service from our waitress and the other staff helped us to enjoy a wonderful dinner. Thank you.

A second Cote for us and a second excellent dining evening.",4
"Disaster turned into triumph by great staffI was due on stage at the Cadogan Hall close by, and after repeated requests, my food finally arrived when I had five minutes before I had to leave. It was a fish pie and not properly heated through. The restaurant was packed and there'd clearly been a breakdown in communications.
The maitre d' was very apologetic. No charge, and an invite to come back later for a free meal.
We went back later and the same maitre d' welcomed us. We had a great meal, served by brilliant staff and we were well looked after. Things go wrong, but it's how a restaurant recovers from them that makes it stand out.",4
"Excellent except for the noise levelWe have eaten at three Cotes--York, Covent Garden and here--this one was the loudest--not much to absorb sound, and a loud guy behind me--no ''inside voice''--but that being said the food and service are perfect--veal and duck are to die for--and good prices. If you get off at Sloane Square station, Cote is across the street next to Peter Jones, a little hard to see with black awnings--discreet I guess. Cherries in Kirsch brandy with the duck--perfect addition. Baguettes--just what you hope for in France, without the trip.",4
Steak dinnerThe Cote Brasserie in Sloane Square is one of our favourite haunts to grab a Rib-eye or Fillet steak with Bearnaise Sauce. Always served with watercress and chips. Service is good and staff are friendly enough. How the Cotes manage such a large and diverse menu is beyond me but we have never strayed from steak so maybe they don't,4
Ideal pop in restaurant for a quick biteMy wife and I were shopping and suddenly decided that we needed a quick lunch. We were not disappointed by our choice of restaurant. We managed to get a table outside so we could watch the world go by and had an excellent steak frites and chicken and walnut salad. Attentive staff ensured a flying visit with good food which exactly suited our requirements.,4
Lovely atmosphereWe stayed at Sloane Square hotel and had our evening meal in the Cote Brasserie. Lovely choice of dishes and friendly efficient staff,5
Pre-Theatre dinnerWe had limited time before going to a local theatre. Service was friendly and super-fast. Their pre-theatre meal deals are inexpensive and you might find your tickets entitle you to a free kir royal to boot! I'd have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant and would certainly use it again if I am in the area.,5
Yum yum and yummyA very nice restaurant located on a very nice place. It serves delicious food. Highly recommended for their mouthwatering breakfast. The eggs royal and croissants are amazing. It’s the taste u need to pamper yourself on a weekend. Friendly staff and the coffee is delicious too. Enjoy the yummy experience,5
"ReliableStopped for a coffee and fresh fruit with my daughter. Polite staff, good location. Very reliable place with a nice atmosphere.",5
Breakfast NirvanaHad a wonderful breakfast here! Highly recommend the vegetarian breakfast which my husband had and said it was his favorite meal in London over a 7 day stay! And he is a foodie! I had scrambled eggs which were perfectly done! Julia Child worthy!,5
"Excellent Food and ValueWe just recently stayed at the adjacent Sloan Square Hotel and had several meals at Cote Brasserie. We had breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each meal was great. We felt the pricing was very fair for the food quality and service. Thank you",5
"Special Business DinnerHaving dined in other Cote Brasseries around the UK, the experience here for 7 people was superb.

We were looked after brilliantly throughout at the table by Boroka, who was ‘smiling’ all the time & genuinely friendly.

The menu was very interesting & offered a great seasonal selection.

Everyone, including a full on vegan, enjoyed their food & wine or other drink.

We will return!",5
Lovely Sunday brunchThis is a great place for breakfast and there is a lot to choose from on the menu. The cooked breakfast with juice and a hot drink for £10 is very reasonable and very delicious. The staff were friendly and attentive - which was an added bonus to the experience. Would definitely visit again!,5
Good mealHad a very nice meal here. Good selection at reasonable prices. Helpful friendly staff. Very busy so best to pre book.,5
"Great place for breakfastWe were staying at the hotel next door but had breakfast at Cote, great food and good service in a nice location",5
Worst breakfast experienceWent with my wife and daughter. Waited 20 minutes to order. After 45 minutes they both were served and I never saw back breakfast. Told them I never got my order. No response. No breakfast. Will never ever go back.No apology from the manager. Awful,1
"Avoid ListHave been here a few times and generally good service and food. Came in tonight, on a Monday night at 5:30 for a beer and pie. Asked where to be seated and was told anywhere. Sat at the first table as you enter the pub, not too busy being early in the evening. Sat at table for 35 minutes without anyone asking if I needed anything. Moved up to the bar and stood for another 10 minutes without any interaction, even tried flagging an employee down, to no avail. They seemed to only be helping one side of the establishment. I watched as two other parties came and eventually get up and leave. I work in the travel industry and frequent London twice a week. Have recommended The Blackbird to numerous people, as of today, it has now been moved to my “must acoid” list when in London.",1
Awful ale.Dreadful pint served for £4.85 by totally disinterested staff. Shocking display by Fuller's who appear to be making money by rinsing visitors who think that beer looks and tastes like this.,1
"Go for the beer. Don't bother with the foodA very disappointing experience. I got a social player and everything about it was sub par. Pakora was doughy, croquets tasted old and the bread dips are misrepresented on the menu due to a slight punctuational error and I was told I was wrong when I asked for what the menu said.
The beer was fantastic and my fathers meal (a pie) was great but I personally will not go back there for food.",1
"You could do so so so much betterhi Kate C,

Thank you very much for taking your time to write a review. Our social plates are very popular and we never had any complaints about it, sorry to hear you didn't enjoy it.

I'm happy to hear your Father liked our pie though!

Kindest,

Egle",1
"Very slow service for average foodNot so great food, staff with an attitude

Visited this place for breakfast and upon entering staff was just standing around, no one was willing to help us find a table. We requested to sit at a table that had just been vacated and asked them to clear it for us. Upon sitting, a part of the table was still sticky and I asked them to clean it and the waitress replied ""we couldn't clean it cause you sat down"" A WHOLE LOT OF ATTITUDE

Food was subpar as well.",1
"Nice pint - overpriced pies!Hi Aparna J,

Thank you for taking your time to write a review.
Sorry to hear you didn't feel welcome in our pub and had to sit on the dirty table. I completely understand that it is not nice to sit at the sticky table and our staff should have cleaned it for you, but we are very busy on breakfast service and sometimes it is hard to keep up with people leaving and others sitting down on dirty tables right away. We always ask people to wait at the bar until the table will be cleaned so it would be done properly, but probably the message was send or understood wrong. Very sorry again for that and hope to see you here again so we could change your opinion about us.

Kindest,

Egle",1
"Terrible: crooksThis establishment was next to my hotel when I checked in. I visited to get dinner around 1830 on a Thursday night. I needed to seat myself and after waiting 30 minutes had to go find a waiter. Other near me had the same challenge.

Once I had the waiter's attention it still took another 30 minutes to get a pint and then order food. The Fish and Chips was quite good but either the place if really understaffed or the expect you to bus your own table and go to the bar to get your food.

Nice ambiance but very slow and impersonal service.",1
"Overall experience at The Blackbird: Poor quality of food and serviceHi Sean,

Thank you for your review, and apologies for your experience. Although we do try are best to provide table service, also we were extremely busy Thursday night. We are very much a traditional pub and when your do find a table it is customary to order at the bar. We are delighted that you enjoyed your food and hope you visit us again soon. We will take you comments to our staff meeting for improvements and again apologise for you experience.

Regards
Natalie",1
"Flat beerTypical Fullers pub with decent beer. The Pride we sampled on this visit was excellent. At £14.50 though the house pie dish feels overpriced for a pie, chips and greens which was served 4 minutes after we ordered it. It came with a miserly portion of gravy. We asked for more which the barman acknowledged but more never came. Would visit again for a pint but I would disagree with Fullers mantra that 'this is the only place to eat a pie'...it will be one place I won't in future.",1
"A cut below Scottish pubsFirst of all, the drinks menu lists all the Fuller's beers without actually mentioning that only three on the list plus their cider are available on tap. The waitress had to,explain that the first two I asked for were in bottles. Not life-threatening but any self-respecting pub ought to make it quite clear what is draught or cask and what is not. My wife's chicken was overcooked and the veg and chips accompanying my main were underdone. To top things off the waitress forgot our second round of drinks and we ended up eating our dinners without anything to wash them down. She did reduce the food bill by ten percent which was a nice gesture but still not enough to make us want to return. I do agree with Ragnar U that the music volume is suitably low that one can carry on a conversation.",2
"Overpriced and underdelivered.Dear Ralph B.

Thank for leaving us feedback. I am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your experience with us. With regards to the food quality, I am sorry to hear your chicken and vegetables were not quite right, if you would have let us know we would have changed these right away for you.
With regards to drinks, we do not have a drinks menu, we do how ever have a some beers listed to show a flavour of what we sell. As a self respecting pub (thank you) the waitress instructed you at order point that we serve certain beers in bottles rather than on draught. My apologies you did not receive your second round, we get extremely busy and sometimes unfortunately things can be missed by human error. If you would of spoken to any of the team we would of helped immediately.
Please accept my apologies and if you would like to discuss further please do hesitate to contact us directly.

Many thanks

The Blackbird.",2
"Couldn't be botheredThe only thing going for our meals was that they were ample. I ordered roast pork as it came with yorkshire pudding and crackling. The yorkshire pudding was overcooked and the crackling was rubbery with no crackle whatsoever. When the waitress finally returned as one of us was rising to leave and this was mentioned and the meal was barely touched she apologized but did nothing to rectify it and the bill was full price. They are aimed at tourists and as such don't care about repeat business, it's all about the location.",2
"Steel Pellet in Pie - Broke tooth!Hi melissajane67,

Thank you for your 2 star review. Sorry to hear you were disappointed with your Roast Pork. I wish though you would have said your comments when you noticed it was not cooked to your liking so we would have been able to do something about it. Again, I'm very sorry to hear that and hope to see you here again so we could change your opinion about us.

Kindest,

Egle",2
"Not goodTwice during our recent stay in the area we attempted to eat/drink at this restaurant. Twice they couldn't have been less interested if we were there or if we stayed. The first night, with a number of tables open (in the pub too), they told me they couldn't seat my daughter and me. Not that there was a wait, but that they couldn't seat us. The next day, my husband and son joined us and we tried to order - waited at the table, went up to the counter - had no interest in serving us. So many other places to eat in the area; won't be trying this one for a third time.",2
"Food was ok - but the toilets were disgusting!!! I wouldn't eat there again now...We were very excited to try the pies at this pub but I had a horribly painful situation after biting a steel pellet which was in my duck, goose and pheasant pie. I broke a piece of my tooth and have damage to my filling (I am waiting for a dentist appointment). I told the waitress and she said there is a warning in the menu. It was a few words in a tiny bubble off to the side of the page. It should be under the description of the pie! Or even better the waiter should point it out when someone orders this pie. I gave it two stars because the food tasted good until I bit the steel pellet.",2
"Dinner with friendsI was looking for places to have dinner with my family. Once I was in London we wanted to have a typical British experience at a pub. Searched for the best places around the hotel with trip advisor and found the Blackbird. The food was just regular. The problem was when a asked for my daughter dessert. I clearly asked for strawberry ice cream. After a few minutes the waiter brought to the table a chocolate brownie, I called him and said that I asked for something different, he said: you've asked for brownie, I can change it if you want. I wanted to hear I'm sorry, I made a mistake, so many tables. I don't recommend this place.",2
"Sloooow service, mediocre foodHi Rodrigo C,

Thank you for your review. I am very sorry for what happened with your dessert, I am pretty sure it was simply misunderstanding. Hope you will take my apology and come back to our pub so we could change your opinion about us.

All the best,

Egle",2
"Poor PieWe came for our last breakfast before heading home from a girly weekend.
Food was ok, even in London though £3 for 2 slices of toast was a rip off! The others proper breakfasts looked nice, around £8-£10 each.
We visited the toilets before we left and they were vile - the smell hit you on the way in and they were filthy.
If we'd have gone to the toilet upon arrival we most certainly wouldn't have eaten there.",2
"Rip off prices!Now I have to admit that it was about 9.50pm when we arrived for dinner, but the waitress seated us immediately - but requested we order quickly, since the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes.
So we all dutifully ordered, and since the specialty on the menu was pies, we all ordered pies.
The food arrived about two minutes after we ordered - the pies obviously having been thrown in microwave!
None of us thought the quality was very good - and one of us had to send his dinner back because the pie was stone-cold! It obviously did not make into the microwave the first time around!
I would not recommend this pub - especially when there so many other great pubs around it.",2
"Horrible singer, but great people.Went to have a pint, as I was waiting take away food. Nice staff, and people. Was a bit crowded. Horrible singer was ruining my pint, as it sounded like someone's being tortured right there at the pub corner.",3
"Beware of last call time for food!Hubby and I came kept walking by this place whenever we'd walk to/from our hotel. Finally, we decided to give it a try on a Sunday night. We walked in to a busy bar/restaurant and was greeted by a waitress asking if we were going to get food. It was around 9:30pm and we said yes (they close at 11:30pm). She then proceeded to tell us that the kitchen would be closing in about 5mins. Normally, we'd walk out and go eat somewhere else, but being tourists, we weren't sure where else to go on such a short notice so we sat down. She cleared our table from the last guests and came back almost immediately to order (we had maybe 30 seconds to look at the menu). Good thing we had already looked at the menu at the hotel and knew what we wanted, but I really wish I could've had some time to look at what else they had.

I ordered the beer/pies flight and hubby had the Sunday Roast. Both dishes were alright, but nothing really to rave about. As others have mentioned, the pies were probably not made in-house since it's a chain. They did the job of filling our stomachs, but we felt really rushed the whole time and it really messed with our moods. During our meal, they started collecting menus and other table top items and the place shifted into a pub completely.

This place was conveniently located for us and probably for anyone staying around Earls Court, but I wish we had known about them closing the kitchen way earlier than their business hours.",3
"Dinner was good, skip breakfastsWe went for dinner and had the pie and beer sampler. Quite enjoyed all three pies and matching beers. Couldn’t eat it all, three pies, plus mash is a lot of food. Hubby had just the steak pie as he’s not a fan of the Indian spice which was offered as part of the trio. He was happy with his meal. Service was good. Prices as expected for this part of London.

Did the full English breakfast on our last day before heading to airport. So disappointing for me. Tomatoes were both the core cut and dried out, the blood pudding I didn’t even try, again an end slice and just sat there kind of staring at me. The eggs were ok, but cooked almost thru to hard so I suggest in future I will specify runny. The rest was not hot, just warm. Just a let down as I was really looking forward to it. On the upside the server was very prompt and friendly.",3
"Decent enough, but watch your tabWe stayed around the corner for a week, so we had a few experiences in here. They have a pretty good selection of beer and cider, and it seems properly kept, so no argument there. The food is about what you normally get in the average London pub, at least for the few things we tried. The service is frankly a little worse than average in terms of attitude and attention to detail. My main negative is that on one occasion I ordered a martini, after first confirming it was something they could and would do. I asked for it to be very dry, and it was probably 1/3 sweet vermouth. No olives available, no lemon twist offered, and then they rang it up at three times the price of a pint of ale. I suppose it was their version of punishment for asking them to do more than pull a pint or unscrew the cap on a bottle of wine. Still, in my book that translates to ""your custom not needed or wanted here"". No worries, there are plenty of others as good or better in the area.",3
"Typical London PubWe enjoyed our fish and chips in this busy pub. The fish was very ""meaty"" and the chips were good. Overall the pub needs some tlc as the fabric is generally dated and a bit the worse for heavy wear. The waitress was very pleasant and obliging.",3
"Pub with PiesPies are their thing, they say. And my pie wasn't bad albeit very small. But if that's your thing, then I expect more than not bad, and slightly larger helpings would be appreciated, too.",3
A nice local pubI think this is a very average pub. It is often busy. The service is a little slow. Food was fine. Good location for nearby hotel.,3
"Overpriced Fullers pubDear ReeSue, Thank you for leaving us a review, I would not say we are an average pub!! but each to there own, we are always busy so I guess we are liked by most. Many thanks",3
"Nice Food, Friendly Service£4,85 for a pint of Pride which was not that good. Extortionate even for Fullers. Busy lively pub near Earls court station. Pies start at about £14 so a pue and two pints would leave you seriously out of pocket. Customers and staff freindly enough but to overpriced to use regularly. Other pubs in the area are less expensive. Nor FS&T's best. Dread to think how much Jack Daniels would be.",3
"Good pie but lousy sunday roast.Been twice in the last few weeks, once in the evening and once for Saturday lunch. The pub is cosy and traditional and the service is friendly and welcoming. The food is average pub food, but we enjoyed what we had. Root vegetable pie, chicken madras pie and the burger. Preferred the mash to the chips. One person found the steak in the steak and ale pie a bit tough. Because this is local to one of our relatives we would come back.",3
"Traditional British pubVery stylish, good beers and food, confy place, nice staff. Located just a few steps from Earl's court. A good place to your happy hour or to catch your favourite football team game.",4
"A really good pubFriendly staff, good food and cold beer. The tasting board of pies and beers was great. I definitely recommend this place.",4
Pleasant place for dinnerWe stayed at the Hotel Indigo just around the corner from the Blackbird. It was very convenient and we enjoyed our meal. My husband ordered a special-- a tapas of pies paired with three beers. Very enjoyable.,4
"One visit great, the next not as great...So our hotel was near the Blackbird, so we ended up going twice. The first visit was good- one of the owners waited on us and we had burgers, which were very good. The fries are good, also.
The next visit was not as good. We had a mini pie appetizer, and that was the highlight. I'd definitely recommend the pies. However, our entrees, the fish and chips and then the fish cakes, left a lot to be desired. All in all, I'd go back- just wouldn't get fish.",4
"Hungry and thirsty RechargingAfter a day of lots of shopping / walking, recharging essential. So; looks great from the outside, classic pub, comfortable inside. Pop in.... Prices pretty reasonable Pies excellent! Beer marvellous! The staff? Absolutely superb Thank you, we will be back.",4
Wonderful pub mealWe were in London staying in the area and kept seeing The Blackbird each time we used the tube. Finally went there for a great pub Sunday dinner our last evening in London. We were not disappointed. My husband had the Sunday roast beef dinner with largest Yorkshire pudding we have ever seen. He loved it. I had one of the award winning steak pies. It was great and one can see why it was award winning. Service was friendly and you had to order at the bar. All part of the pub experience. We would definitely recommend The Blackbird pub and would love to go again.,4
"Delicious lunchStopped at The Blackbird for a late lunch. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the establishment as well as a delicious lunch. I ordered the London Ale and Steak Pie, which was served with chips (fries). Delicious, and the cold beer was a great compliment for the meal. Would definitely visit again.",4
"Always busy, but made room for usGreat staff! We were glad the Blackbird had room for our group of seven on both occasions we stopped there. We realize that's not easy to do...,in fact at several stops on our UK tour we had to split up for meals.
Everybody was happy with food quality, and prices seemed to be fairly standard.",4
"Nearly 5 Stars.....😁Lovely couple of hours spent having a drink and a homemade pie.
The pies are delicious .... top notch and it would have been 5 stars if the filling was piping hot....sadly one pie was just lukewarm.
Staff are lovely and the French wine was absolutely perfect... yum",4
"Very good pub grub, good beer & good wine.Prosecco comes in little bottles though - an expensive way of serving it but it does keep it fresh.
The menu choice is good, especially their signature pies, & we enjoyed our meal.
Service was fast, friendly & efficient.
Prices average for the area.
Easy to find - right opposite the Earls Court tube station.",4
"Pub culture at its bestThe pub was in close proximity to the Mombray Court Hotel! Food was great at an affordable price! Hamburgers highly recommended, am excellent example of a British pub!",5
"Excelent Pie, fish and chips!It was very nice! Gently staff, great foods and drinking! Pies, breakfast, waffle and fish! They are amazing...",5
amazing Lamb piethis restaurant and pub was located just adjacent to our hotel and had quite a good food selection. I tried the lamb and mushroom pie which was extremely tasty and quite filling ...,5
"Great Pub! welcoming staffThis was the first English Pub I ate at on my trip, and definitely the best. The interior had the feel of what a pub should be lots of people enjoying good food and drink, great decor, and above all a great staff of servers, who made me feel welcome and helped me through the experience. looking over the menu i decided to try the House Pie (a changing baked pie) mine was to be steak and shallots cooked in a thick brown gravy and topped with a beautiful crust, accompanying my meal was a warm kale salad, mashed potatoes and gravy. this was the perfect way to start off a trip to London, will be back and bring friends.",5
"Excellent beer in lively surroundingsPopped in here to catch a couple of beers and watch England v Croatia. Plenty of good real ales, all brewed locally and excellent Nachos. Friendly, efficient staff and chatty clientele. Very enjoyable (except the footie result).",5
Great traditional English pub!We loved the place with its traditional decor and very nice staff. The tasting board was amazing with their ale and pies. Good selection of beer and gin. Really close to Earl's Court underground station and the best place to get a great taste of London.,5
"Good pub foodGood pub food, nice staff, jolly atmosphere, traditional Victorian pub decor, just steps from Earl's Court underground station.",5
"Great Gastropub!We visited The Blackbird while staying at the Hotel Indigo in Kensington. It was super close to the hotel which was great!
We went for lunch, and got the Somerset Brie & Cranberry Sandwich, Salmon and Haddock Fish Cakes, and the Prawn & Crawfish Sandwich.
Everything was pretty good! The Salmon and Haddock Fish Cakes were pretty heavy on potato and there wasn’t as much fish in it. The Somerset Brie & Cranberry Sandwich was good but not amazing or anything!
It’s definitely a good restaurant though, since it’s very convenient if your staying in Earls Court.",5
"Great atmosphere! Great food! Great pub!We were staying in the Earl’s Court area and needed a go to place to meet fellow Canadians also travelling at the same time, and this place was awesome. Friendly staff, helpful and while it was busy, you could hold a conversation easily. We enjoyed a breakfast here and also a dinner. The veggie breakfast had to be one of the best brekkies ever, and the coffee was just the jolt we needed. It was a great place to have a couple of pints at after a day of being a tourist.

After leaving London, and touring throughout England and Wales we came back to east London, for a day before our flight left. We decided to return to the Blackbird for our final meal to end the trip, and we were not disappointed.",5
"Outstanding food, great drinks, friendly serviceWe spent a week in London and this was the only restaurant we visited twice. The food was so good that we had to go back for a second stop.

The meat pies were fantastic. We had the sampler platter on one visit, sharing it between two of us. The flavors and preparation were ideal.

On the second visit, I had the Sunday beef roast. Everything was just brilliantly assembled and delicious. The Yorkshire pudding was extraordinary.",5
